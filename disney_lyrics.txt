[Verse 1]
I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

[Refrain 1]
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know where I cannot go
Where I long to be

[Chorus 1]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Verse 2]
I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

[Refrain 2]
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus 2]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

[Chorus 3]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go


[Verse 1]
Okay, okay, I see what's happening here
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui, breathe it in
I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod

[Chorus]
What can I say except "you're welcome"?
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy!

[Verse 2]
Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high? This guy
When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?
You're looking at him, yo!
Oh, also I lassoed the sun, you're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also, I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees

[Chorus]
So, what can I say except "you're welcome"?
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome, you're welcome

[Verse 3]
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly, I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been, I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tapping
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey

[Chorus]
Well anyway, let me say "you're welcome"
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say "you're welcome"
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome
'Cause Maui can do everything but float
You're welcome, you're welcome

[Outro]
And thank you!


[Verse 1]
I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

[Pre-Chorus]
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be

[Chorus]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Post-Chorus]
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I know everybody on this island seems so happy
On this island, everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go


[Intro: Aladdin and Jasmine]
How are you doing that?
It's a magic carpet
I-it's lovely...
You don't...you don't wanna go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world
Is it safe?
Sure, do you trust me?
What?
Do you trust me?
Yes...

[Verse 1: Aladdin]
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Refrain 1: Aladdin]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "no"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Refrain 2: Jasmine (and Aladdin)]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)

[Verse 2: Jasmine]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Refrain 3: Jasmine (and Aladdin)]
A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath; it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Refrain 4: Aladdin (and Jasmine)]
A whole new world
(Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Refrain 5: Aladdin (and Jasmine)]
A whole new world
(A whole new world)
That's where we'll be
(That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase
(A wondrous place)
For you and me


[Intro]
Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba
Sithi uhm ingonyama

Nants ingonyama bagithi baba
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama
Ingonyama

Siyo Nqoba
Ingonyama
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There is more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The Circle of Life

It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The Circle of Life


[Verse 1]
Here comes a wave meant to wash me away
A tide that is taking me under
Swallowing sand, left with nothing to say
My voice drowned out in the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't cry
And I won't start to crumble
Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down

[Chorus]
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

[Verse 2]
Written in stone
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
"Stay in your place"
"Better seen and not heard"
But now that story is ending

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I
I cannot start to crumble
So come on and try
Try to shut me and cut me down

[Chorus]
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless
Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

[Bridge]
Try to lock me in this cage
I won't just lay me down and die
I will take these broken wings
And watch me burn across the sky
Hear the echo saying:

[Chorus]
I won't be silenced
Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

[Outro]
All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless


[Intro: Opetaia Foa'i]
Tatou o tagata folau e vala’auina

[Hook 1: Chorus, Opetaia Foa'i]
Aue, aue
Nuku i mua

Aue, aue

[Verse 1: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
We read the wind and the sky when the sun is high
We sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze
At night, we name every star
We know where we are
We know who we are, who we are

[Hook 2: Chorus, Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Aue, aue
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

[Hook 3: Chorus, Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Aue, aue
We are explorers reading every sign
We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain
Aue, aue
Te fenua te mālie
Nae ko hakilia
We know the way


[TAMATOA]
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful, baby
Did your granny say, "Listen to your heart"?
"Be who you are on the inside"?
I need three words to tear her argument apart
Your granny lied

I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't you know?
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh, and here they come, come, come
To the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm, fish dinners

I just love free food
And you look like seafood

Well, well, well
Little Maui's having trouble with his look
You little semi-demi-mini-god
Ouch! What a terrible performance
Get the hook! (Get it?)
You don't swing it like you used to, man

Yet I have to give you credit for my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide, I can't

I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You could try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod
To beat a decapod (Look it up)
You will die, die, die
Now it's time for me to take apart
Your aching heart

Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans
Who made you feel wanted
You try to be tough
But your armour's just not hard enough

Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney
Ever seen someone so

Shiny?
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea
Just for me

You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny


[Verse 1]
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

[Verse 2]
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got troubles, and I've got 'em, too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and we see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

[Bridge]
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too, maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you, boy

[Verse 3]
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see, it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me


[Letra de "Un Poco Loco" ft. Gael García Bernal]

[Intro: Luis Angel Gómez Jaramillo]
Uhh...
¡Ahh-ayy!

[Verso 1: Luis Angel Gómez Jaramillo]
Que el cielo no es azul
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Que es rojo dices tú
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Ves todo al revés
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Creo que piensas con los pies
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor

[Coro: Luis Angel Gómez Jaramillo]
Tú me traes un poco loco, un poquititito loco
Estoy adivinando qué quieres y pa' cuándo
Y así estoy celebrando
Que me he vuelto un poco loco

[Verso 2: Gael García Bernal, Luis Ángel Gómez Jaramillo, Juntos]
Chiflado tú me vuelves, eso está un poco loco
Tu mente que despega, tú siempre con ideas
Con mi cabeza juegas, todo es un poco loco

[Estribillo: Gael García Berna]
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas (¡vámonos, Miguelito!)
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas

[Outro: Gael García Bernal & Luis Ángel Gómez Jaramillo]
¡Un poquititititititititi-titititito loco!
¡Ay, ay, ah!


[Intro: Choir]
Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti
Beatae Mariae semper Virgini
Beato Michaeli archangelo
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis

[Verse 1]
Beata Maria
You know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud

(Et tibit Pater)

Beata Maria
You know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd

(Quia peccavi nimis)

Then tell me, Maria
Why I see her dancing there
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul

(Cogitatione)

I feel her, I see her
The sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control

(Verbo et opere)

[Chorus]
Like fire
Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning
Desire
Is turning me to sin

[Verse 2]
It's not my fault
(Mea culpa)
I'm not to blame
It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
(Mea maxima culpa)
It's not my fault
(Mea culpa)
If in God's plan
(Mea culpa)
He made the devil so much
Stronger than a man
(Mea maxima culpa)

Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone

[Chorus]
Hellfire
Dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or
Your pyre
Be mine or you will burn

[Outro]
God have mercy on her
(Kyrie Eleison)
God have mercy on me
(Kyrie Eleison)
But she will be mine
Or she will burn!


[Intro]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

[Verse 1]
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn’t keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
Well, now they know

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Verse 2]
It’s funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can’t get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know left a life behind
But I’m too relieved to grieve

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Bridge]
Standing frozen in the life I’ve chosen
You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Buried in the snow

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Outro]
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Na na
(Na na, na na) Let it go
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na) Let it go
(Na na) Ooh
(Na na na na na) Let it go


[Intro]
I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?

[Verse 1]
I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen

[Verse 2]
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean

[Verse 3]
Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (Endless)

[Bridge]
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn

[Chorus]
If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
'Cause the devil's on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

[Outro]
I want what I deserve


[Verse 1]
Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet, before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you

[Verse 2]
Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

[Bridge]
I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say good-bye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[Verse 3]
Time is racing toward us, till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order, and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon


[Verse 1: Anna]
The window is open, so's that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they're opening up the gates

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anna]
There'll be actual, real-life people
It'll be totally strange
Wow, am I so ready for this change

[Chorus 1: Anna]
'Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in the zone
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

[Interlude: Anna]
I can't wait to meet everyone!
Oh, what if I meet the one?

[Verse 2: Anna]
Tonight, imagine me, gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anna]
But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've led so far

[Chorus 2: Anna]
For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

[Bridge: Elsa]
Don't let them in
Don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel
Put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

[Pre-Chorus 3: Elsa and Anna]
But it's only for today (It's only for today)
It's agony to wait (It's agony to wait)
Tell the guards to open up the gates (The gates)

[Chorus 3: Anna and Elsa]
For the first time in forever (Don't let them in, don't let them see)
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of (Be the good girl you always have to be)
A chance to change my lonely world (Conceal)
A chance to find true love (Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know)

[Coda: Anna]
I know it all ends tomorrow
So it has to be today
'Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way!


[ARIEL, spoken]
Maybe he's right. Maybe there is something the matter with me
I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad...

(sung)
Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you think
"Sure, she's got everything"
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal, I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em? Oh - feet!

Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a - what's that word again? Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word? Burn?

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea, wish I could be part of that world


[TIMON & (PUMBAA)]
I can see what's happening (What?)
And they don't have a clue (Who?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line - our trio's down to two. (Oh.)

(In a sarcastic mock-French accent)
Ze sweet caress of twilight
(Back to normal, but still sarcastic)
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

[SIMBA]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me

[NALA]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

[TIMON]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed

[PUMBAA]
His carefree days with us are history

[TIMON & PUMBAA]
In short: Our pal is doomed


[RAPUNZEL]
All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be

And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you

[FLYNN]
All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go

[FLYNN & RAPUNZEL]
And at last I see the light

[FLYNN]
And it's like the fog has lifted

[FLYNN & RAPUNZEL]
And at last I see the light

[RAPUNZEL]
And it's like the sky is new

[FLYNN & RAPUNZEL]
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you

Now that I see you


[Intro: Meg Donnelly]
Oh
La la la la la
Oh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
I know it might be crazy
But did you hear the story?
I think I heard it vaguely
A girl and a zombie
Oh, tell me more, boy
Yeah
Sounds like a fantasy
Oh, what could go so wrong
With a girl and a zombie
You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darker side
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me
Right from the start you caught my eye
And something inside me came to life
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Yeah, yeah
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Girl, you look delicious
Oh, I mean gorgeous
Well, now you're getting fearless
No, I'm just rooting for us
If different was a super power
We'd be so flawless
Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours
I'm rooting for us
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark
Imagine it now they start a spark
You got my attention
What happens next, then?
Movies and long walks in the park
Hanging out anywhere we want
I like the way you're thinking
I can almost see it

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday

[Bridge: Meg Donnelly]
So let them talk if they wanna
Let them talk if they're gonna
We're gonna do what we wanna
Let them talk, let them talk
If they wanna, they wanna

[bell rings]

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday

Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!

[PUMBAA]
Hakuna matata! Ain't no passing craze!

[TIMON]
It means no worries, for the rest of your days...

[TIMON & PUMBAA]
It's our problem-free philosophy...

[TIMON]
Hakuna matata!

Why, when he was a young warthog...

[PUMBAA]
When I was a young warthog...

[TIMON]
Very nice

[PUMBAA]
Thanks

[TIMON]
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after every meal

[PUMBAA]
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And, oh, the shame!

[TIMON]
He was ashamed

[PUMBAA]
Thought of changin' my name!

[TIMON]
Oh, what's in a name?

[PUMBAA]
And I got downhearted

[TIMON]
How did ya feel?

[PUMBAA]
Everytime that I...

[TIMON]
Hey! Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!

[PUMBAA]
Oh. Sorry...

[TIMON & PUMBAA]
Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze

[SIMBA]
It means no worries for the rest of your days

[TIMON]
Yeah, sing it, kid!

[TIMON & SIMBA]
It's our problem-free

[PUMBAA]
Philosophy

[TIMON & PUMBAA & SIMBA]
Hakuna Matata!

[TIMON & PUMBAA & SIMBA]
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna...

[SIMBA]
It means no worries for the rest of your days

[TIMON & PUMBAA & SIMBA]
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!

(SIMBA scat sings to fade)


(Make way for Prince Ali!)
(Say hey! It's Prince Ali!)

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a bright new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
Oh! You're gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect, down on one knee!
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as 10 regular men, definitely!
(He faced the galloping hordes)
(A hundred bad guys with swords)
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

(He's got 75 golden camels)
Don't they look lovely, June?
(Purple peacocks, he's got 53)
Fabulous Harry, I love the feathers!
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
(Has he got a zoo?)
(I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie)

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak, weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!

He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him!)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
(With 60 elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for Prince Ali!)


[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

[Pre-Chorus]
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there’s nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out


[Hook 1]
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life

[Verse 1]
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few

[Interlude 1]
(You eat ants!?)
Haha, you better believe it
You're going to love the way they tickle
(Mowgli, watch out!)

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

[Hook 2]
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life

[Verse 2]
Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw

[Interlude 2]
Have I given you a clue?
(Golly, thanks Baloo!)
(Pawpaw, hah! Of all the silly gibberish)
C'mon Baggy, get with the beat!

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

[Verse 3]
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard

[Verse 4]
And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!


[Intro]
Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(Uishi kwa uishi kwa)
Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(Uishi kwa, uishi kwa)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, and the wind is talkin'
Yeah, yeah, for the very first time
With a melody that pulls you towards it
Paintin' pictures of paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Watch the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, woah

[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, and the water's crashin'
Trying to keep your head up high
While you're trembling, that's when the magic happens
And the stars gather by, by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Let the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, yeah

[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-ight

[Bridge]
So go into that far off land
And be one with the Great I Am, I Am
A boy becomes a man, woah

[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah
Spirit, yeah, watch the heavens open, open
Yeah
Spirit, spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-i-ight

[Outro]
So go into a far off land
And be one with the Great I Am


You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know...

You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

How high will the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon

For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind


[Verse 1]
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Outro]
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best


[GRAMMA TALA]
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are

The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on Earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
"Moana, you've come so far"
Moana listen, do you know who you are?

[MOANA, spoken]
Who am I?

(sung)
I am a girl who loves my island
And the girl who loves the sea, it calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me

I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me

And the call isn't out there at all
It's inside me
It's like the tide
Always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart
You'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way

I am Moana!


[CHIEF TUI]
Moana, make way, make way
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is all you need
The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song

[VILLAGERS]
Who needs a new song?
This old one's all we need

[CHIEF TUI]
This tradition is our mission
And Moana there's
So much to do
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need
We share everything we make
We joke and we
Weave our baskets
The fishermen come back
From the sea

[VILLAGERS]
Make way!
That's all you need
We make!

A ha!

[BABY MOANA]
I wanna see...

[CHIEF TUI]
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief and
There you are

[VILLAGERS]
There you are


[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is where you are

[CHIEF TUI]
Consider the coconut

Consider its tree
We use each part
Of the coconut
That's all we need

[SINA]
We make our nets
From the fibers

The water is
Sweet inside

We use the leaves
To build fires

We cook up
The meat inside


[CHIEF TUI]
Consider the coconuts

The trunks and the leaves
[VILLAGERS]

The what?

We use each part
Of the coconut
That's all we need



We make our nets
From the fibers

The water is
Sweet inside

We use the leaves
To build fires

We cook up
The meat inside



Consider the coconuts

Ha!

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
The island gives us what we need

[YOUNG MOANA]
And no one leaves...

[CHIEF TUI]
That's right we stay
We're safe and
We're well provided
And when we look
To the future
There you are
You'll be okay
In time you'll learn
Just as I did

[VILLAGERS]
 
 
 
 
 
There you are

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
You must find happiness
Right where you are

[GRAMMA TALA]
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous, ha!
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like
Well there you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside
Is who you are

[MEN]
We make our nets
From the fibers
The water's sweet inside
We use the leaves
To build fires
To cook up
The meat inside

[CHIEF TUI]
The village believes in us

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
The village believes
The island gives us
What we need

[CHIEF TUI]
And no one leaves

[MOANA]
So here I'll stay
My home, my
People beside me
And when I
Think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way
I'll have my people
To guide me
We'll build our
Future together

Cause every path
Leads you back to

You can find happiness right
[SINA & WOMEN]

We weave our nets
From the fibers
A real tasty treat inside
We sing the songs
In our choirs
We have mouths
To feed inside

[WOMEN]
That's right!
The island gives us
What we need

[VILLAGE]
There we are

Where we are
Where you are
Where you are
Where you are


[Toddler Anna +  Young Elsa]
Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play!
I never see you anymore, come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies, and now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Go away, Anna!)
Okay, bye

[Young Anna]
Do you wanna build a snowman
Or ride our bikes around the halls?
I think some company is overdue, I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls
Hang in there, Joan
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Adult Anna]
Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say "have courage" and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in
We only have each other, it's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a snowman?


[Verse 1: Jordan Fisher]
I see what's happening here
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
It's nice to see that humans never change

[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Fisher]
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes it's really me, breathe it in
I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod

[Chorus: Jordan Fisher & Lin-Manuel Miranda]
So what can I say except "You're welcome"
For the tide, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
So what can I say except "You're welcome"
For the tide, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcomeI'm just an ordinary demi-guy

[Rap: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Honestly, I can go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was me, I was messing around
I killed a snake, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now we've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tikkity tappin'
Singing and scratchin'
Flipping and snappin'
People are clappin', hearing me rap and
Bring the chorus back in

[Chorus: Jordan Fisher]
Well anyway, let me say you're welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome
'Cause Maui's the ultimate god woah

[Outro: Jordan Fisher]
You're welcome, you're welcome


[Intro: All]
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack hit 'em 'til the armor cracks

[Verse 1: China Anne McClain, Dove Cameron, Sofia Carson]
This could get a little sticky
How to win this battle could be tricky but I know the best way
Fall back let me lead, you hold the line
And we'll bring them to their knees
Swords in the air if you're with me
They got us outnumbered one to fifty
But victory is ours 'cause I got a strategy, you take the left
And the rest of you can follow me (Un-uh)
This is my crew
This is my squad
This is my turf
Oh my gosh, look guys
We've got bigger fish to fry
Put your differences aside
'Cause right now we're on the same side

[Chorus: Sofia Carson, Girls, All]
Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast they're too heavy to react

[Verse 2: Dove Cameron & China Anne McClain]
This situation's getting kinda heavy
Hold your weapons tight keep 'em steady
'Cause if we stick together we can make it out alive
I'll cause a distraction, you attack them from the side
All my soldiers stand at the ready
We can cut 'em up like a confetti
We'll hit 'em from the front, you counter from behind
Don't forget the fate of Auradon's on the line

[Pre-Chorus: All, Dove Cameron]
This is all out war, they got us outnumbered
The way the swords clash is the sound of the thunder
And we are not going under, we will never run for cover
We battle for the victory and ride for each other

[Chorus: Sofia Carson, Girls, All]
Until the night falls everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
We can counter their attack hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast they're too heavy to react

[Verse 3: Dove Cameron]
Suit of armor strong and true
Make this metal bust a move!

[Outro: Sofia Carson, Girls, All]
Until the night falls, you can trust
I'm gonna help you win this battle because
I got your back, got your back
Got your back, got your back
All for one and that's a fact, knights fall pitch black


[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh

[Verse 1]
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next

[Pre-Chorus]
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh

[Verse 2]
Look at how far you've come, you filled your heart with love
Baby you've done enough, take a deep breath
Don't beat yourself up, don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Bridge]
I'll keep on making those new mistakes
I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything


[Verse 1]
I have often dreamed of a far-off place
Where a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be

[Chorus]
I will find my way, I can go the distance
I'll be there someday, if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to feel like I belong

[Intrumental interlude]

[Chorus]
I am on my way, I can go the distance
I don't care how far, somehow I'll be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to find where I belong


[Verse 1: ZAYN]
I can show you the world: shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride

[Chorus: ZAYN & Zhavia Ward]
A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "no," or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world, a dazzling place I never knew
But when I’m way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I’m in a whole new world with you

[Verse 2: Zhavia Ward]
Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath; it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world, with new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "no," or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world (Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment, red-letter)
I’ll chase them anywhere, there’s time to spare
Anywhere, ooh, ooh (There's time to spare)
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Outro: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
That’s where we'll be (That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (A wondrous place)
For you and me


[Intro: Anna and Hans]
Okay, can I just - say something crazy?
I love crazy!

[Verse 1:Anna and Hans]
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you
I was thinking the same thing!
'Cause, like, I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue...

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anna, Hans, Both]
But with you (But with you)
I found my place (I see your face)
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

[Chorus 1: Anna, Hans, Both]
Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Love is an open door
With you, with you
With you, with you
Love is an open door

[Verse 2: Anna, Hans, Both]
I mean it's crazy (What?)
We finish each others'—
Sandwiches!
That's what I was gonna say!
I never met someone who thinks so much like me
Jinx. Jinx again!
Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation
You and I were just meant to be!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anna, Hans, Both]
Say goodbye (Say goodbye) to the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore

[Chorus 2: Anna, Hans, Both]
Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Life can be so much more
With you, with you
With you, with you
Love is an open door (Door)

[Outro: Anna and Hans]
Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?
Can I say something even crazier?
Yes!


[Intro]
Ariel, listen to me
The human world, it's a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they've got up there

[Verse 1]
The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

[Hook 1]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

[Verse 2]
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
(Guess who's gon' be on the plate)

[Hook 2]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us in fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles

[Hook 3]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here naturally
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea

[Verse 2]
The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat, they know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow

[Hook 3]
Under the sea
Under the sea
When the sardine begin the beguine
It's music to me
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea


[MOANA]
There's a line where the sky meets the sea and it calls me
But no one knows, how far it goes
All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me
I'm on my own, to worlds unknown

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Is a choice I make, now I can't turn back
From the great unknown where I go alone
Where I long to be

See her light up the night in the sea, she calls me
And yes I know that I can go
There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me
Soon I'll know how far I'll go


[SIMBA]
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

[ZAZU]
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair

[SIMBA]
I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my roar!

[ZAZU]
Thus far, a rather... uninspiring thing

[SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

[ZAZU]
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...

[SIMBA]
No one saying do this

[ZAZU]
Now when I said that, I -

[NALA]
No one saying be there

[ZAZU]
What I meant was...

[SIMBA]
No one saying stop that

[ZAZU]
Look, what you don't realize...

[SIMBA & NALA]
No one saying see here

[ZAZU]
Now see here!

[SIMBA]
Free to run around all day

[ZAZU]
Well, that's definitely out

[SIMBA]
Free to do it all my way!

[ZAZU]
I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart

[SIMBA]
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start

[ZAZU]
If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa - I wouldn't hang about... aagh!
This child is getting wildly out of wing

[SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm standing in the spotlight!

[ZAZU]
Not yet!

[ANIMALS]
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

[ANIMALS & SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait... to be king!


[Intro: Genie (Will Smith)]
Here I go!
Unh, ooh, woo!
Back up! Uh-oh! Watch out! Unh!
You done wound me up!
'Boutta show you what I'm workin' with, unh!

[Verse 1: Genie (Will Smith)]
Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
All you gotta do is rub that lamp
And then I'll say

[Verse 2: Genie (Will Smith)]
Mister– Man, what's your name? Whatever–
What will your pleasure be?

You ain't never had a friend like me

[Refrain: Genie (Will Smith), spoken]
Oh! Unh!
It's the big part, watch out!
It's the big part, oh!

[Bridge: Genie (Will Smith)]
Can your friends do this?

Can your friends pull this
Outta they little hat?
Can your friends go–
I'm the genie of the lamp
I can sing, rap, dance, if you give me a chance, oh!

[Verse 4: Genie (Will Smith)]
Don't sit there buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so

You ain't never had a friend like me!


[HOOK HAND THUG]
I'm malicious, mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
But despite my evil look
And my temper, and my hook
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
Can'tcha see me on the stage performin' Mozart?
Ticklin' the ivories 'til they gleam?
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley
Thank you!
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

[THUGS]
He's got a dream!
He's got a dream!

[HOOK HAND THUG]
See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem!
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers
Like everybody else
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
La la la la la la la la la la la la!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes
And let's not even mention my complexion
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter, and my nose
I really want to make a love connection
Can't you see me with a special little lady
Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover, not a fighter
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
He's got a dream!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
He's got a dream!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
And I know one day romance will reign supreme!
Though my face leaves people screaming
There's a child behind it, dreaming
Like everybody else
I've got a dream

[THUGS]
Tor would like to quit and be a florist
Gunther does interior design
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime
Bruiser knits
Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

[HOOK HAND THUG]
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns!

[FLYNN]
I have dreams, like you - no, really!
Just much less touchy-feely
They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone
Surrounded by enormous piles of money

[RAPUNZEL]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
She's got a dream!

[RAPUNZEL]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
She's got a dream!

[RAPUNZEL]
I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam!

[THUGS]
Yeah!

[RAPUNZEL]
And with every passing hour
I'm so glad I left my tower
Like all you lovely folks
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
She's got a dream!
He's got a dream!
They've got a dream!
We've got a dream!
So our diff'rences ain't
Really that extreme!
We're one big team!
Call us brutal
Sick

[HOOK HAND THUG]
Sadistic

[BIG NOSE THUG]
And grotesquely optimistic

[THUGS]
'Cause way down deep inside
We've got a dream!

[HOOK HAND THUG]
I've got a dream!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!

[RAPUNZEL]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
Whoo whoo whoo whoo!

[ALL]
Yes, way down deep inside
I've got a dream!
Yeah!


[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim]
I'm fired up
Tryouts today
I'm going to blow ‘em away yeah
Dad says I can't go wrong, no
As long as I keep this on, oh
Seabrook's been the best like forever
Moms counting on me no pressure
Cheer's in my family genes
Come on let's do this thing

Now what up everybody
Let me set the scene
Fresh new start for your boy young z
You saw pops for a dad he's cool
He's just a little stressed about my first day of school
They say "be careful those humans can be mean"
But I'm still going out for the football teamThis might look rough but it's home sweet home
Just a little bit of dust and a little bit of mold
But it ain't so bad on this side of tracks
We make it work with a little bit of swag

On this side we can all keep winning
If we just try to fit in

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & All]
Watch it come together
Be the best one ever
Because it's my time
This is going to be my year

Been waiting for this moment
Yeah I'm gonna own it
You can watch me shine
This is gonna be my year
My year my year
My my my year
My year
My year
My year
My year

[Verse 2: Kylee Russell & Milo Manheim & James Godfrey]
Now let me introduce you to my friend Eliza
We'll never be accepted zombies need to rise up
Fight the good fight stand for whats right
We get the worst jobs and a curfew at night
They make us wear uniforms that all look the same
Why's it just us being treated this way
I say we stick it to their institution
You want justice we need a revolution

Yeah you got a point but today's an improvement
'Cause baby steps is still movement
Hey Bonzo come and spit a verse
A zig zagg gwag gwad ziggy got gon
Ziggity got goat zag ziggy got zong
He just dropped that in zombie

Yeah all he said is he's hungry

[Verse 3: Trevor Tordjman & Meg Donnelly]
My cuz Bucky's the man
Look at how perfect he lands
Our very own cheer rock star

No more autographs please stay where you are
Another year and I only get better
Another cheer another varsity letter
This year we just can't lose
Well I'm gonna win you'all can come too

[Chorus: All]
My year
My year
My year
My year
Watch it come together
Be the best one ever
Because it's my time
This is gonna be my year
Been waiting for this moment
Yeah I'm gonna own it
You can watch me shine
This is gonna be my year
My year my year
My year my year
My my my year
My year my year

This is gonna be my year


[SCAR, spoken]
I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain

(sung)
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But–thick as you are–pay attention!
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares!

So prepare for the chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

[SHENZI]
And where do we feature?

[SCAR]
Just listen to teacher

I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Yeah, be prepared! Haha! We'll be prepared! For what?

[SCAR, spoken]
For the death of the king!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Why? Is he sick?

[SCAR, spoken]
No, fool, we're going to kill him. And Simba too!

[SHENZI, spoken]
Great idea! Who needs a king?

[SHENZI & BANZAI & ED, spoken]
No king, no king, la la la la la la!

[SCAR, spoken]
Idiots! There will be a king!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Hey, but you said, uh...

[SCAR, spoken]
I will be king! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!

[HYENAS, spoken]
Yeah! Alright! Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

(sung)
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

[SCAR]
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

[SCAR & HYENAS]
So prepare for the coup of the century (Oooh!)
Be prepared for the murkiest scam (Oooh... La! La! La!)
Meticulous planning (We'll have food!)
Tenacity spanning (Lots of food)
Decades of denial (We repeat)
Is simply why I'll (Endless meat)
Be king undisputed (Aaah...)
Respected, saluted (...aaah...)
And seen for the wonder I am (...aaah!)
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared (Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!


[Verse 1: Megara]
If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that

[Bridge 1: Muses]
Who d'you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

[Chorus 1: Megara + Muses]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh)
(Why deny it? Uh-oh)
It's too cliché
I won't say I'm in love

[Verse 2: Megara]
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"

[Bridge 2: Muses]
(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?

[Chorus 2: Megara + Muses]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in)
(Check the grin; you're in love)
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
(You're doin' flips)
(Read our lips: "You're in love")

You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud!)
(It's okay, you're in love)

Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in love
(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)
(Sha-la-la-la la la, ahh)


[Verse 1: Hades, Mal]
Listen, little girl
You're talking to a god
And I don’t wanna hear the drama
Kindness ain't my brand
Oh, I guess that's why you ran
Try being married to your mama!
You stink at being a dad
Poor Mali, are you sad?
Not as sad as you without your powers
I didn’t come to fight
For once, do something right
I steal souls, were you expecting flowers?

[Pre-Chorus: Hades, Mal]
I only need you 'cause I came here for something
I've given you everything, by giving you (me) nothing

[Chorus: Hades, Mal]
I did what I had to do (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, you only did what's best for you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do, yeah

[Verse 2: Hades, Mal]
You were never there
Guess you don't have a phone
You never called to say "I miss you"
Ha ha ha, are you kidding? Is this a joke?
You need to let it go
You're stronger with those daddy issues
Oh! Thank you!
Show me some respect
It ain't easy to neglect
My attention would've made you softer
Ooh-hoo! Should I be proud?
Don’t turn this thing around
I guess you are your father’s daughter, ha, ha, ha

[Pre-Chorus: Hades, Mal]
Don't think I need you, I just came here for something
I’ve given you everything, by giving you (me) nothing

[Chorus: Hades, Mal]
I did what I had to do (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I made it on my own, no thanks to you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do

[Bridge: Hades, Mal, both]
How 'bout I go with you and we'll spend some time?
How 'bout you stay here ’cause you're out of your mind!
Let's make new memories, you can show me the town
No, you can keep your memories now
Get over it
I am over it!
I'm over you being over it!
Let's dance

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Both]
I did what I had to do (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, you only did what's best for you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove, you do-
When push comes to shove, you do-
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do


[Verse 1]
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say -

[Chorus]
"Mr. Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down"
You ain't never had a friend like me, ha ha ha
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come on, whisper what it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me

[Verse 2]
Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
You're the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you wish, it's yours! True dish
How about a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Wah-ah-ah, mo-my
Wah-ah-ah, no-no
Wah-ah-ah, my my my

[Bridge]
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Hey, looky here, ha ha
Can your friends go "Abracadabra," let 'er rip
And then make the sucker disappear

[Verse 3]
So don't you sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so

[Chorus]
Mister Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend, you ain't
Never had a friend, never had a friend

[Outro]
You ain't
Never... had a...
Friend... like
Me
Ya-ha-ha
Wah-ha-ha
You ain't never had a friend like me!


[Verse 1]
Don't freak out, it's okay
'Cause  true love can save the day
And  I think we feel the same
But I don't know
When we met, it was sweet
He  was oh so into me
Seems  like things are meant to be
But I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Does  he love me? Or does he love me not?
Do I love him? And is it strong enough?

[Chorus]
One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One  kiss, one kiss
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)

[Verse 2]
Keep it cool, keep it calm
Think he's loved me all along
But maybe I got it wrong
So I don't know (hey)
He's so good, got my back
But maybe I'm just too bad
Could we be a perfect match?
Now, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Does he love me? Or does he love me not?
Do I love him? And is it strong enough?

[Chorus]
One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)
Yeah, here I go

[Bridge]
I feel my heartbeat beating saying "It's gonna work"
But if I'm dream-dream-dreaming, this is gonna hurt
Either I will or I won't
What if I do and he don't?
Is he my Romeo?
Oh, there's only one, one way to really know

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)

[Outro]
Here I go
Here I go
Here I go


[Verse 1: Trevor Tordjman]
Listen up, it's not so tough
I'll tell you how it's done
There's really nothing better
Than to hear you're number one
And I know how to get a crowd
Right up and on their feet
So if you want them in it
I'll show you how to get it

[Pre - Chorus: Trevor Tordjman, Emilia McCarthy & Both]
Ain't no mountain we can't climb
Nothing keeps us down
Got that fire in our soul
Never count us out
We got one thing on our minds
Call it victory
Yeah, that's where we're headed
And we know how to get it

[Chorus: All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Post - Chorus: All]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! So get up out of our way
We're fired up, we're fired up
We're fired up
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! So get up out of our way
We're fired up, we're fired up
We're fired up
Aah!

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly, Carla Jeffery]
Been waiting for this day to come
And it was all so clear
Since I was a little girl
I saw me standing here
And all the times they told me "Walk away"
I said "Forget it"
I knew where I was headed
And I was gonna get it

[Pre - Chorus: Meg Donelly]
Ain't no mountain we can't climb
Nothing keeps us down
Got that fire in our soul
Never count us out
We got one thing on our minds
Call it victory
Yeah, that's where we're headed
And we know how to get it
Whoa!

[Chorus: All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Post - Chorus: All]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
No!
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up

Yaah!
Mmm
You guys got moves
But can you win over a crowd?
Get them to worship you
Like they worship me!
[cheering]
Hey, who am I fooling?
Bucky's never gonna let me on the team
He'll cut my wings
I'm never gonna fly
We are the Mighty Shrimp
We wanna hear you shout
From the left and from the right
[booing]
Aw, come on!
You don't have what it takes
Bye!
You'll never be a Shrimp!
Waah-hoo-hoo!
Wow!
Awesome!
Whoo!
[cheering]

[Bridge: Meg Donnelly]
Welcome to the Mighty Shrimps
Turn up the volume now
We are the Mighty Shrimp
It's time to show you now
We got the stuff to light you up
It's getting hotter now
We're getting hotter now
It's getting hotter now

[Chorus: All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Post - Chorus: All]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
Nothing's gonna get in our way
Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
Fired up, fired up

[cheering]


[NARRATOR, spoken]
Once upon a time
In a far-off kingdom
There lay a small village
At the edge of the woods

[CINDERELLA]
I wish

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And in this village

[CINDERELLA]
More than anything

[NARRATOR, spoken]
Lived a young maiden

[CINDERELLA]
More than life
More than jewels

[NARRATOR, spoken]
A carefree young lad

[JACK]
I wish
More than life

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And a childless baker

[BAKER &  BAKER'S WIFE]
I wish

[NARRATOR, spoken]
With his wife

[BAKER]
More than anything

[WIFE]
More than the moon

[BAKER'S WIFE]
I wish

[CINDERELLA]
The King is giving a Festival

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
More than life

[JACK]
I wish

[CINDERELLA]
I wish to go to the Festival

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
More than riches

[CINDERELLA]
And the ball

[JACK]
I wish my cow would
Give us some milk

[CINDERELLA & BAKER'S WIFE]
More than anything

[BAKER]
I wish we had a child

[JACK]
Please, pal-

[BAKER'S WIFE]
I want a child

[JACK]
Squeeze, pal

[CINDERELLA]
I wish to go to the Festival

[JACK]
I wish you'd give us some
Milk or even cheese
I wish

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
I wish we might have a child
I wish

[STEPMOTHER]
You wish to go to the Festival?

[NARRATOR, spoken]
The poor girl's parents had died

[STEPMOTHER]
You, Cinderella, the Festival?
You wish to go to the Festival?

[FLORINDA]
What, you, Cinderella, the Festival?
The Festival?!

[LUCINDA]
What, you wish to go to the Festival?

[ALL THREE]
The Festival?
The King's Festival?

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And now she lived with her stepmother

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
The Festival?
Ha!

[NARRATOR, spoken]
Who had two daughters of her own

[FLORINDA]
Look at your nails!

[LUCINDA]
Look at your dress!

[STEPMOTHER]
People would laugh at you

[CINDERELLA]
Nevertheless
I still want to go to the Festival
And dance before the Prince

[STEPMOTHER & STEPSISTERS]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[NARRATOR, spoken]
All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart
The young lad had no father and his mother

[JACK'S MOTHER]
I wish

[NARRATOR, spoken]
Well, she was at her wit's end

[JACK'S MOTHER]
I wish my son were not a fool
I wish my house was not a mess
I wish the cow was full of milk
I wish the walls were full of gold
I wish a lot of things
(spoken)
What in heaven's name are you doing
With the cow inside the house?

[JACK, spoken]
I thought if he got nice and warm
He might produce some milk

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
It's a she
How many times do I have to tell you
Only she's can give milk?

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And then there was a hungry little girl
Who always wore a red cape

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
I wish
It's not for me
It's for my Granny in the woods
A loaf of bread, please
To bring my poor old hungry
Granny in the woods
Just a loaf of bread, please

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
Cinderella, if you can pick up these lentils
And finish your chores in time
Then you may go to the ball with us
Come along ladies

[STEPSISTERS, spoken]
Yes, Mother

[LUCINDA, spoken]
Good luck

[CINDERELLA]
Come, little birds
Down from the eaves
And the leaves
Over fields
Out of castles and ponds

[JACK]
Now, squeeze, pal

[CINDERELLA]
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Quick, little birds
Flick through the ashes
Pick and peck, but swiftly
Sift through the ashes
Into the pot

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Now listen to me well, son
Milky-White must be taken to market

[JACK, spoken]
But, mother, no he's the best cow in the world

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Was
She has been dry for weeks now
With no food or money
We've got no choice but to sell her
Look at her

[JACK, spoken]
But, Milky-White's my best friend

[JACK'S MOTHER]
Look at her
There are bugs on her dugs
There are flies in her eyes
There's a lump on her rump
Big enough to be a hump

[JACK, spoken]
But

[JACK'S MOTHER]
We've no time to sit and dither
While she wither's wither with her
And no one keeps a cow for a friend!
(spoken)
Sometimes I wonder what's going on in that head of yours

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods
It's time to go
I hate to leave
I have to go
Into the woods
It's time, and so
I must begin my journey
Into the woods
And through the trees
To where I am
Expected ma'am
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Now you're certain of your way?

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
The way is clear
The light is good
I have no fear
Nor no one should
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood
I sort of hate to ask it
But do you have a basket?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Yes, we do

[BAKER, spoken]
I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Oh, shhhh
Now, don't stray and be late, alright?

[BAKER, spoken]
You might save some of those sweets for Granny?
Oh my

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Just, leave it

[BAKER, spoken]
She's a thief!

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods
And down the dell
The path is straight
I know it well
Into the woods
And who can tell
What's waiting on the journey?
Into the woods
To bring some bread
To Granny who
Is sick in bed
Never can tell
What lies ahead
For all that I know
She's already dead
But into the woods
Into the woods
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
And home before dark

[FLORINDA, spoken]
Cinderella!

[LUCINDA, spoken]
Get up here!

[CINDERELLA]
Fly, birds
Back to the sky

[FLORINDA, spoken]
We're waiting!

[CINDERELLA]
Back to the eaves
And the leaves
And the fields
And the

[FLORINDA]
Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella!
Are you really wearing that?

[LUCINDA]
Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella
Can't you hide it with a hat?

[CINDERELLA]
You look beautiful

[FLORINDA]
I know

[LUCINDA]
She means me

[FLORINDA]
No she didn't

[CINDERELLA]
Mother said be good
Father said be nice
That was always their advice
So be nice, Cinderella
Good, Cinderella
Nice good good nice

[FLORINDA]
Tighter!

[CINDERELLA]
What's the good of being good
If everyone is blind
Always leaving you behind?
Never mind, Cinderella
Kind Cinderella
Nice good nice kind good nice

[FLORINDA, spoken]
Ow! Not that tight!
God!

[BAKER, spoken]
Who might that be?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
We've sold our last loaf of bread!

[BAKER, spoken]
It's the witch from next-door

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
We have no bread

[WITCH, spoken]
I don't want your bread

[BAKER, spoken]
Then what is it you wish?

[WITCH, spoken]
It's not what I wish
It's what you wish
Nothing cooking in that belly now is there?
And there will never be
Unless you do exactly as I say
In three days time a blue-moon will appear
Only then can the curse be, undone

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
What curse?

[WITCH, spoken]
The one I placed on this house

[BAKER, spoken]
What are you talking about?

[WITCH, spoken]
In the past, when you were no more than a babe
Your father brought his young wife
And you to this cottage
They were a lovely couple
But not lovely neighbors
You see
Your mother was with child
And she developed an unusual appetite
She admired my beautiful garden
And she told your father that
What she wanted more than anything
In the world, was
Greens, greens, nothing but greens:
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery
Asparagus and watercress and
Fiddle ferns and lettuce
He said, "All right,"
But it wasn't, quite
Cause I caught him in the autumn
In my garden one night!
He was robbing me
Raping me
Rooting through my rutabaga
Raiding my arugula and
Ripping up the rampion
My champion! My favorite!
I should have laid a spell on him
Right there
I could have turned him into stone
Or a dog...
Or a chair...
But I let him have the rampion-
I'd lots to spare
In return, however
I said, "Fair is fair:
You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear
And we'll call it square."

[BAKER, spoken]
I had a brother?

[WITCH, spoken]
No. But, you had a sister

[BAKER, spoken]
Where is she?

[WITCH, spoken]
She's mine now!
And you'll never find her
Small price to pay for what
Else your father stole from me
It cost me my youth, my beauty
My mother warned me
She would punish me
With the curse of ugliness
If I ever lost any of them

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Lost what?

[WITCH, spoken]
The beans

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Beans?

[WITCH, spoken]
The special beans
I'd let him go, I didn't know
He'd stolen my beans
I was watching him crawl
Back over the wall
Then bang! Crash!
A lightning flash!
Well, that's another story
Never mind-
Anyway, at last
The big day came
And I made my claim
"Oh, don't take away the baby,"
They shrieked and screeched
But I did
And I hid her
Where she'll never be reached
And your father cried
And your mother died
When for extra measure-
I admit it was a pleasure-
I said, "Sorry
I'm still not mollified."
And I laid a little spell on them-
You, too, son-
That your family tree
Would always be a barren one

[BAKER, spoken]
How could you do that?

[WITCH, spoken]
And when your mother died
Your father deserted you
Your father was no father so why should you be?
So there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes
And my garden thrives-
You should see my nectarines!
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens:
Don't ever never ever
Mess around with my greens!
Especially the beans

[JACK, spoken]
Yeah, but why do we have to go to the next village?

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Because, everyone in this village
Knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks

[JACK, spoken]
That's cheating!

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
We're starving, Jack!
Don't you understand that?
Now, you're not to accept less than five pounds for her
Are you listening to me?

[JACK, spoken]
Yes

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
How much are you to ask?

[JACK, spoken]
No more than five pounds

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Less than five!

[JACK, spoken]
Than five!

[JACK'S MOTHER]
Into the woods
The time is now
We have to live
I don't care how
Into the woods to sell the cow
You must begin the journey!
Straight to the woods
And don't delay
We have to face
The marketplace
Into the woods to journey's end

[JACK]
Into the woods to sell a friend

[WITCH, spoken]
You wish to have
The curse reversed?
I'll need a certain
Potion first
Go to the woods and bring me back
One: the cow as white as milk
Two: the cape as red as blood
Three: the hair as yellow as corn
Four: the slipper as pure as gold
Bring me these
Before the chime
Of midnight
In three day's time
Tis' then the blue moon reappears
Which comes but once each hundred years
Just bring them and
I guarantee
A child as perfect
As child can be
Go to the wood!

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
Ladies
Our carriage waits

[CINDERELLA, spoken]
Now may I go to the Festival?

[STEPMOTHER]
The Festival?
(sung)
Darling, those nails!
Darling, those clothes!
Lentils are one thing but
Darling, with those
You'd make us the fools of the Festival
And mortify the Prince!

[CINDERELLA, spoken]
The Festival lasts three nights
Surely, you could let me be there for one of them

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
The King is trying to find his son a wife!
Not a scullery maid!
We must be gone!
Go!

[CINDERELLA]
I wish

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Beans?
These must be the witch's beans!
We'll take them with us

[BAKER, spoken]
We?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Yes!

[BAKER, spoken]
We?
You're not coming
It's not safe out there

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
I can help you!

[BAKER, spoken]
No!
I can do this on my own
(sung)
The spell is on my house
Only I can lift the spell
The spell is on my house

[BAKER'S WIFE]
No, no, the spell is on our house
We must lift the spell together
The spell is on our house!

[BAKER, spoken]
Now tell me what am I to return with?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Ugh, You don't remember?
(sung)
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold

[BAKER]
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold

[CINDERELLA]
I still wish to go to the Festival
But how am I ever to get to the Festival?

[BAKER]
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn

[CINDERELLA]
I know!
I'll visit Mother's grave
The grave at the willow tree
And tell her I just want to
Go to the King's Festival

[BAKER]
The slipper as pure as gold
The cow, the cape
The slipper as pure as gold

[BAKER'S WIFE]
The hair!

[CINDERELLA & BAKER]
Into the woods
It's time to go
It may be all
In vain, you/I know
Into the woods-
But even so
I have to take the journey

[CINDERELLA, BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
Into the woods
The path is straight
You know it well
But who can tell

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
Into the woods to lift the spell

[CINDERELLA]
Into the woods to visit Mother

[JACK'S MOM]
Into the woods to sell the cow!

[JACK]
To get the money!

[CINDERELLA]
To go to the Festival!

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods to grandmother's house!

[ALL]
The way is clear
The light is good
I have no fear
Nor no one should
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood
No need to be afraid there

[BAKER]
There's something in the glade there

[ALL]
Into the woods
Without delay
But careful not
To lose the way
Into the woods
Who knows what may
Be lurking on the journey?
Into the woods
To get the thing
That makes it worth
The journeying
Into the woods

[STEPMOTHER & STEPSISTERS]
To see the King

[JACK & JACK'S MOTHER]
To sell the cow

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
To make the potion

[ALL]
To see
To sell
To get
To bring
To make
To lift
To go to the Festival!
Into the woods!
Into the woods!
Into the woods
Then out of the woods
And home before it's dark!

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel...

(sung)
Look at you, as fragile as a flower
Still a little sapling, just a sprout
You know why we stay up in this tower

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I know but...

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
That's right, to keep you safe and sound, dear
Guess I always knew this day was coming
Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest
Soon, but not yet

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
But --

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Shh!
Trust me, pet
Mother knows best

Mother knows best
Listen to your mother
It's a scary world out there
Mother knows best
One way or another
Something will go wrong, I swear
Ruffians, thugs
Poison ivy, quicksand
Cannibals and snakes
The plague

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No!

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Yes!

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
But --

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Also large bugs
Men with pointy teeth, and
Stop, no more, you'll just upset me
Mother's right here
Mother will protect you
Darling, here's what I suggest
Skip the drama
Stay with mama
Mother knows best

Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy
On your own, you won't survive
Sloppy, underdressed
Immature, clumsy
Please, they'll eat you up alive
Gullible, naïve
Positively grubby
Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague
Plus, I believe
Gettin' kinda chubby
I'm just saying cause I wuv you
Mother understands
Mother's here to help you
All I have is one request

(spoken)
Rapunzel?

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
Yes?

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
Yes, Mother

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
I love you very much, dear

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I love you more

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
I love you most

(sung)
Don't forget it
You'll regret it
Mother knows best


[MOANA & ENSEMBLE]
Ou mata e matagi
I have crossed the horizon to find you
Ou loto mamaina toa
I know your name
Manatu atu
They have stolen the heart from inside you
Taku pelepele
But this does not define you
Manatunatu
This is not who you are
You know who you are


[Verse 1]
Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Verse 2]
Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Refrain]
There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah


[Verse 1]
Here you are alone, and you deserve it
Your friends have turned to stone
And that's on you
You had a cause to serve but did you serve it?
Or did you see yourself in a way that wasn't true?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is not your father's fairytale
And no, it's not your mother's fault you fail
So when your story comes to light
Make sure the story that they write

[Chorus 1]
Goes once upon a time a girl tried harder
Once upon a time she tried again
Once upon a braver choice
She took a risk
She used her voice
And that will be my once upon a time
This time

[Verse 2]
Why tell all those lies?
You feel unworthy
Like there isn't solid ground for you to stand
But a stack of lies is not a firm foundation
You cannot build a castle on a mountain made of sand

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is not your mother's dark desire
And no, it's not your father's hair on fire
Turns out it's you who's not awake
So if there's change you wanna make

[Chorus 2]
Take once upon a time she fought a dragon
Once upon a time that beast was me
Once upon a misspent youth
She faced herself
She spoke the truth
That's how I see my once upon a time
This time

[Verse 3]
Life is not a storybook but life unfolds in chapters
Turn the page and start to make amends
There's no pre-written guarantee of "Happily ever after"
Step into your greatness before your story ends
So when your story ends

[Chorus 3]
They'll say once upon a time a girl flew higher
Once upon a time she made things right
Once upon a tie that binds
She changed her heart
To change their minds
That's got to be my once upon a time

[Outro]
This once upon a time
I'll finally see my once upon a time
This time


[NARRATOR, spoken]
You go girls...

[CALLIOPE, spoken]
We are the muses
Goddesses of the arts
And proclaimers of heroes

[TERPSICHORE, spoken]
Heroes like Hercules

[THALIA, spoken]
Honey you mean Hunk-ules!
Woohoo, I'd like to make some sweet music-

[CALLIOPE, spoken]
Our story actually begins long before Hercules
Many eons ago

(sung)
Back when the world was new
The planet earth was down on its luck
And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok

[THALIA]
It was a nasty place!
There was a mess where ever you stepped

[CALLIOPE]
Where chaos reigned and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept

[THALIA, spoken]
Woo! Sing it girlfriend

[ALL MUSES]
But then along came Zeus!

[CALLIOPE]
He hurled his thunderbolt

[ALL MUSES]
He zapped-

[CALLIOPE]
Locked those suckers in a vault

[ALL MUSES]
They're trapped-
And on his own stopped chaos in its track
And that's the gospel truth
The guy was too type A to just relax!

[TERPSICHORE]
And that's the world's first dish

[THALIA, spoken]
Yeah, baby

[MELPOMENE]
Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth

[ALL MUSES]
Though honey it may seem impossible
That's the gospel truth!
On Mt. Olympus life was neat
And smooth as sweet vermouth
Though honey it may seem impossible
That's the gospel truth


[Intro: All]
From the North to the South
From the East to the West
Lost boys, lost girls
You all know you're the best
Hit the streets, it’s your day
Turn it up, now's your chance
It's time to get up on your feet and dance!
Whoo!

[Verse 1: Dove Cameron, Cameron Boyce, Sofia Carson, *Booboo Stewart*]
Anybody wanna be like us?
Everybody wanna be like us!
Hey
All the boys from Auradon
And the girls ’cause they know what's up
Huh!
Your life could change today
Your life could change today
*These streets named after us
Because we paved the way*

[Pre-Chorus: Dove Cameron, Sofia Carson]
Everyone come and take your shot
Now's the time, show 'em what you got
'Cause everyone is gonna get their chance
They said that being from the Isle was bad

[Chorus: All]
Well, it's good to be bad
And we're proof of that
Used to be lost, now we're on the map
Used to steal stacks, now we’re giving back
Remember that
It’s good to be... bad
If you got pride
Raise your V's up high
Wave ’em wide, side to side
Feel the vibe
It's good to be bad

[Verse 2: Sofia Carson]
I wanna see you all rep your block
I wanna see you all rep your block
Hey!
Show your pride, let me hear ya shout
We're from the Isle of the Lost!
Yes!
We're here to celebrate
We’re here to elevate
If you're down, then make your move
But you best not hesitate
Come on!

[Pre-Chorus: Dove Cameron]
Today's the day that you won't forget
The best to come ain't happened yet
Take a bow, it won't be your last
You're from the Isle if anybody asks
Whoo!

[Chorus: All]
It's good to be bad
And we're proof of that
Used to be lost, now we're on the map
Used to steal stacks, now we're giving back
Remember that
It's good to be...
Bad!
If you got pride
Raise your V's up high
Wave 'em wide, side to side
Feel the vibe
It's good to be bad

[Verse 3: Booboo Stewart, Cameron Boyce]
They can try to deny our style
But we were born this way
'Cause you can take the VK outta the Isle
But you can't take the Isle out the VK
If you wanna make it hype, not a moment to waste
Make it loud, make it live, make it jump to the bass
Make it what you want, but you'd better make your case
'Cause the Isle makes us and we're reppin' this place

[Break: All]
So when I say "V", you say "K"
V! K! V! K!
When I say "all", you say "day"
All! Day! All! Day!
When I say "V", you say "K"
V! K! V! K!
When I say "all", you say "day"
All day!
Come on
Hey!
It's good to be... bad

[Chorus: All]
It's good to be bad
And we're proof of that
Used to be lost, now we're on the map
Used to steal stacks, now we're giving back
Remember that
It's good to be... bad!
If you got pride
Raise your V's up high
Wave 'em wide, side to side
Feel the vibe
It's good to be... bad


Born of cold and winter air
And mountain rain combining
This icy force both foul and fair
Has a frozen heart worth mining

So cut through the heart, cold and clear
Strike for love and strike for fear
See the beauty, sharp and sheer
Split the ice apart!
And break the frozen heart

Hyup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!
Hyup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

Beautiful!
Powerful!
Dangerous!
Cold!
Ice has a magic, can't be controlled
Stronger than one! Stronger than ten!
Stronger than a hundred men!

Hyup!

Born of cold and winter air
And mountain rain combining!
This icy force both foul and fair
Has a frozen heart worth mining!

Cut through the heart, cold and clear!
Strike for love and strike for fear!
There's beauty and there's danger here
Split the ice apart!
Beware the frozen heart...


[Intro: Bulda]
What’s the issue, dear?
Why are you holding back from such a man?

[Verse 1: Bulda, Trolls]
Is it the clumpy way he walks?
Or the grumpy way he talks?
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped
Weirdness of his feet?
And though we know he washes well
He always ends up sort of smelly
But you’ll never meet a fellow who’s as
Sensitive and sweet!

[Chorus: Trolls]
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper
So he’s got a few flaws
Like his peculiar brain dear
His thing with the reindeer
That’s a little outside of nature’s laws!
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper
But this we’re certain of
You can fix this fixer-upper
Up with a little bit of love!


[Verse 1: Dove Cameron, China Anne McClain, Both]
It's time to it bring together
Time for a brand new start
We gonna put it in mo-oh-otion
Break down what keeps us apart
No more, no division we down
New team, got the vision, united
So we stand, now we living marching

[Pre-Chorus: Dove Cameron, China Anne McClain, Both]
In the light, one two, one two like
I see you (You see me)
Imperfect (Perfectly)
Face to face we can see clearly our similarities
Like day and night, wrong or right
We come together for a good time

[Chorus 1: All]
We're gonna break this down
We're gonna rock the town
Everyone all around
Let's be whoever like this
Stronger together like this

[Verse 2: China Anne McClain, Jadah Marie, Thomas Doherty, China & Thomas, *Sofia Carson*, -Cameron Boyce-, +Booboo Stewart+]
Believing in second chances
And we're all starting today
Marching on in a new land
Our World's A Better, A Better Place
*Welcome, the addition new love*
-Unity, new beginning for us-
+Harmony that's the mission marching+

[Pre-Chorus: Core 4, Pirate Crew & Jadah Marie, All]
In the light, one two, one two like
I see you (You see me)
Imperfect (Perfectly)
Face to face we can see clearly our similarities
Like day and night, wrong or right
We come together for a good time

[Chorus 2: All]
We're gonna break this down
We're gonna rock the town
Everyone all around
Just be whoever like this
Stronger together like this
We reunited like this

[Bridge: All, Dove Cameron]
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down (Down!)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 2: All, Sofia Carson, China Anne McClain]
We're gonna break this down (Break this down)
We're gonna rock the town (Oh, we're gonna rock this town)
Everyone all around (Oh, around)

[Chorus 2: All, Sofia Carson, China Anne McClain, *Dove Cameron*]
We're gonna break this down (*Come on! We're gonna break this down*)
We're gonna rock the town (Come on, *everybody on the isle gonna like this*)
Everyone all around (Oh, around)
Just be whoever like this
Stronger together like this (Stronger together like this)
We reunited like this (Hey!)

[Outro: All]
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-bringing it down


[RAPUNZEL]
7 AM, the usual morning lineup:
Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean
Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15

And so I'll read a book
Or maybe two or three
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit
And cook and basically
Just wonder when will my life begin?

Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb
Sew a dress!

And I'll reread the books
If I have time to spare
I'll paint the walls some more
I'm sure there's room somewhere
And then I'll brush and brush
And brush and brush my hair
Stuck in the same place I've always been

And I'll keep wonderin' and wonderin'
And wonderin' and wonderin'
When will my life begin?

And tomorrow night
Lights will appear
Just like they do on my birthday each year
What is it like
Out there where they glow?
Now that I'm older
Mother might just
Let me go...


[Intro: Anna]
You don't have to protect me! I'm not afraid!
Please don't shut me out again, please don't slam the door
You don't have to keep your distance anymore

[Verse 1: Anna]
'Cause for the first time in forever
I finally understand
For the first time in forever
We can fix this hand in hand
We can head down this mountain together!
You don't have live in fear
'Cause for the first time in forever
I will be right here

[Verse 2: Elsa & Anna]
Anna, please go back home, your life awaits
Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates (Yeah, but —)
I know
You mean well, but leave me be
Yes, I'm alone, but I'm alone and free
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me

[Verse 3: Elsa & Anna]
Actually, we're not (What do you mean, "you're not"?)
I get the feeling you don't know (What do I not know?)
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep, deep snow (What?)

[Anna]
You've kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere

[Elsa]
Everywhere?

[Anna]
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it!

[Elsa]
No, I can't, I — I don't know how!

[Verse 4: Anna & Elsa]
Sure you can! I know you can!
'Cause for the first time in forever (Oh I'm such a fool, I can't be free!)
You don’t have to be afraid (No escape from the storm inside of me)
We can work this out together (I can’t control the curse!)
We’ll reverse the storm you’ve made (Anna, please, you’ll only make it worse!)
Don’t panic (There’s so much fear!)
We’ll make the sun shine bright (You’re not safe here!)
We can face this thing together (No!)
We can change this winter weather (Ahhh...)
And everything will be all right (I can't!)


[Esmeralda]
I don't know if you can hear me
Or if you're even there
I don't know if you would listen to a gypsy's prayer

Yes, I know I'm just an outcast
I shouldn't speak to you
Still I see your face and wonder
Were you once an outcast too?

God help the outcasts
Hungry from birth
Show them the mercy
They don't find on Earth
God help my people
We look to you still
God help the outcasts
Or nobody will

[Townspeople]
I ask for wealth
I ask for fame
I ask for glory to shine on my name
I ask for love I can possess
I ask for God and his angels to bless me

[Esmeralda]
I ask for nothing
I can get by
But I know so many
Less lucky than I

Please help my people
The poor and down-trod
I thought we all were children of God

God help the outcasts
Children of God


[MARY POPPINS]
Uncle Gutenberg was a bookworm
And he lived on Charing Cross
The memory of his volumes brings a smile
He would read me lots of stories
When he wasn't on the sauce
Now I'd like to share the wisdom
Of my favourite bibliophile
He said a-

Cover is not the book
So open it up and take a look
'Cause under the covers one discovers
That the king may be a crook
Chapter titles are like signs
And if you read between the lines
You'll find your first impression was mistook
For a cover is nice
But a cover is not the book

[AUDIENCE]
Ta-ru-ra-lee, ta-ra-ta-ta-ta!
Ta-ru-ra-lee, ta-ra-ta-ta-ta!

[PENGUIN]
Mary Poppins, could you give us an example?

[MARY POPPINS]
Certainly!

Nellie Rubina was made of wood
But what could not be seen was though
Her trunk up top was barren
Well, her roots were lush and green
So in Spring when Mr Hickory saw her blossoms blooming there
He took root despite her bark
And now there's seedlings everywhere

[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
Which proves
A cover is not the book
So open it up and take a look
'Cause under the covers one discovers
That the king may be a crook
Chapter titles are like signs
And if you read between the lines
You'll find your first impression was mistook
For a cover is nice
But a cover is not the book

[JACK]
Should we do the one about the wealthy widow?

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, by all means!

[JACK]
Always loved that one

[MARY POPPINS]
Well, go on then!

[JACK]
Lady Hyacinth Macaw
Brought all her treasures to a reef

[MARY POPPINS]
Where she only wore a smile

[JACK]
Plus two feathers, and a leaf

[MARY POPPINS]
So no one tried to rob her
'Cause she barely wore a stitch

[JACK]
For when you're in your birthday suit

[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
There ain't much there to show you're rich!

[ALL]
Oh, a cover is not the book
So open it up and take a look
Cause under the covers one discovers
That the king maybe a crook
Ta-ru-ra-lee, ta-ru-ra-la, ta-ru-ra-lee, ta-ra-ta-ta!

[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
You'll find your first impression was mistook (Ya-da-da-da)
For a cover is nice
But a cover is not the book

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, give us the one about the dirty rascal, why don't ya?

[JACK]
Isn't that one a bit long?

[MARY POPPINS]
Well, the quicker you're into it, the quicker you're out of it.

[JACK]
Once upon a time
In a nursery rhyme
There was a castle with a king
Hiding in a wing
'Cause he never went to school to learn a single thing

He had scepters and swords
And a parliament of lords
But on the inside he was sad
Egad!
Because he never had a wisdom for numbers
A wisdom for words
Though his crown was quite immense
His brain was smaller than a bird's
So the queen of the nation
Made a royal proclamation:
"To the Missus and the Messers
The more or lessers
Bring me all the land's professors"
Then she went to the hair dressers

And they came from the east
And they came from the south
From each college they poured knowledge
From their brains into his mouth
But the king couldn't learn
So each professor met their fate
For the queen had their heads removed
And placed upon the gate
And on that date
I state their wives all got a note
Their mate was now the late-great

But then suddenly one day
A stranger started in to sing
He said, "I'm the dirty rascal
And I'm here to teach the king"
And the queen clutched her jewels
For she hated royal fools
But this fool had some rules
They really ought to teach in schools

Like you'll be a happy king
If you enjoy the things you've got
You should never try to be
The kind of person that you're not
So they sang and they laughed
For the king had found a friend
And they ran onto a rainbow for
The story's perfect end

So the moral is you musn't let
The outside be the guide
For it's not so cut and dried
Well unless it's Dr. Jekyll
Then you better hide, petrified!
No, the truth can't be denied
As I now have testified
All that really counts and matters
Is the special stuff inside

[AUDIENCE]
He did it!

[ALL]
Oh, a cover is not the book
So open it up and take a look
'Cause under the covers one discovers
That the king may be a crook

[MARY POPPINS]
So please listen to what we've said

[JACK]
And open up a book tonight in bed

[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
So one more time before we get the hook

[JACK]
Sing it out strong!

[AUDIENCE]
A cover is nice

[MARY POPPINS]
Please take our advice!

[AUDIENCE]
A cover is nice

[JACK]
Or you'll pay the price!

[AUDIENCE]
A cover is nice

[ALL]
But a cover is not the book

[AUDIENCE]
Ta-ru-ra-lee, ta-ru-ra-la-la
Ta-ru-ra-lee, ta-ru-ra-la-la
Ta-ru-ra-lee, ta-ru-ra-la-la, la, la!

[Verse]
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar, a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

[Bridge]
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

[Verse]
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that gleam in your eyes is so familiar, a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream


[Verse 1: Aladdin]
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess
Now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Refrain 1: Aladdin]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Refrain 2: Jasmine & Aladdin]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

[Verse 2: Jasmine, Aladdin, Both]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Refrain 3: Jasmine & Aladdin]
A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath, it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Refrain 4: Aladdin & Jasmine]
A whole new world
Every turn, a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment, red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Refrain 5: Aladdin, Jasmine, Both]
A whole new world
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me


[GEORGE BANKS]
With tuppence for paper and strings,
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in a flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite

Oh oh oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite

[BERT]
When you send it flyin' up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over 'ouses and trees
With your fist 'olding tight
To the string of your kite

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh oh oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go, fly a kite!

When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those to love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true


[MUSES]
Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro! Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S-R-O
He was a no one (a zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho, he's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that

When he smiled the girls went wild with
"Oohs" and "aahs"
And they slapped his face on every vase
(On every "vase")

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian earn

Say "Amen!," there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"? (Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre? (Hercules!)
Isn't he bold? (No one braver!)
Isn't he sweet? (Our favorite flavor!)
Hercules!, Hercules!
Hercules!, Hercules!
Hercules!, Hercules!

Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll - undefeated
Riding high (and the nicest guy) - not conceited
He was a nothing (a zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho, he's a hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero (awww, yeah!)
Yes indeed!


[JACK]
Let's say you're lost in a park, sure
You can give in to the dark or
You can trip a little light fantastic with me
When you're alone in your room
Your choice is just embrace the gloom
Or you can trip a little light fantastic with me

For if you hide under the covers
You might never see the day
But if a spark can start inside your heart
Then you can always find the way
So when life is getting dreary
Just pretend that you're a leerie
As you trip a little light fantastic with me

[JOHN]
What's a leerie?

[JACK]
Why, it's what we lamplighters call ourselves, of course. Time to send out the call to arms. Leeries, trip the lights and lead the way!

Now when you're stuck in the mist, sure
You can struggle and resist or
You can trip a little light fantastic with me
Now say you're lost in the crowd, well
You can stamp and scream out loud or
You can trip a little light fantastic with me

And when the fog comes rolling in, just
Keep your feet upon the path
Mustn't mope and frown or worse, lie down
Don't let it be your epitaph

So when life is getting scary, be your own illuminary
Who can shine their light for all the world to see
As you trip a little light fantastic with me

A leerie loves the edge of night
Though dim, to him the world looks bright
He's got the gift of second sight

[LEERIES]
To trip a little light fantastic!

[JACK]
A leerie's job's to light the way

[LEERIES]
To take the night and make it day

[JACK]
We mimic the moon, yes that's our aim

[JACK and LEERIES]
For we're the keepers of the flame

[JACK]
And if you're deep inside a tunnel
When there is no end in sight
Well just carry on until the dawn
It's darkest right before the light

As you trip a little light fantastic
Won't you trip a little light fantastic
Come on, trip a little light fantastic with me

[instrumental]
(Oy! Oy! Oy!)

[ANGUS]
Come along, join us in a bit of a kick and prance

[JOHN]
What did he say?

[JACK]
Kick and prance -- it means "dance"! It's leerie speak. You don't say the words you mean, you say something that rhymes, only -- here, I'll show you how it works. Angus, give us your weep and wail. To the rest of ya, that means"tale"

[ANGUS]
I was short of a sheet

[JACK]
It was in the street

[ANGUS]
Just a tumble down a sink

[JACK]
Just to get himself a drink

[ANGUS]
Then I pinch what's fatter

[JACK]
He grabbed his ladder

[ANGUS]
To smile and smirk-

[JACK and ANGUS]
To work!

[JACK]
You see, there's nothing to it

[ANNABEL]
Can you speak leerie, Mary Poppins?

[MARY POPPINS]
Can I speak leerie?

[JACK]
Of course she can. She's Mary Poppins!

[GEORGIE]
Can we do it with you?

[JOHN and ANNABEL]
Please?

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, very well then

[JACK]
Children, tell us yer sorry tale

[LEERIES]
Give us your weep and wail!

[JOHN]
Well, we had this bowl

[MARY POPPINS]
Rabbit in the hole

[ANNABEL]
That fell and broke

[MARY POPPINS]
Bicycle spoke

[JOHN]
So we took it to a shop

[MARY POPPINS]
Like a lollipop

[GEORGIE]
And went upside down!

[MARY POPPINS]
That's a circus clown

[JOHN]
Then went to the bank

[MARY POPPINS]
Rattle and clank

[ANNABEL]
Got lost in the fog

[MARY POPPINS]
Lump on a log

[JOHN]
Till we found a friend

[MARY POPPINS]
To stand and defend

[ANNABEL]
Who took us on a trip

[MARY POPPINS]
Snapped a horse's whip

[CHILDREN]
And we tripped a little light fantastic!

[MARY POPPINS]
Now that sounds a little bit bombastic

[JACK]
But they tripped the light-

[CHILDREN]
We tripped a light!

[ALL]
Let's trip a little light fantastic!

[instrumental]

[LEERIES]
Join us, Mary Poppins!
Hey!

[instrumental]

[JACK]
(spoken) You've got it-
Now let's get you all back home!

[ALL]
Now if your life is getting foggy
That's no reason to complain

[JACK]
There's so much in store, inside the door

[ALL]
Of 17 Cherry Tree Lane

[JACK]
So when troubles are incessant
Simply be more incandescent
For your light comes with a lifetime guarantee
As you-

[ALL]
Trip a little light fantastic

[JACK]
Won't you-

[ALL]
Trip a little light fantastic

[JACK]
Come on!

[ALL]
Trip a little light fantastic

[JACK]
With me!

[CHILDREN and LEERIES]
Went to the bank! Rattle and clank!
Met with the boss! Pitch and toss!
Got lost in the fog! Lump on a log!

[ALL]
Trip a little light fantastic!

[Belle]
Little town, it's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town, full of little people
Waking up to say

[Townfolks]
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

[Belle]
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

[Baker, spoken]
Good Morning, Belle!

[Belle, spoken]
Good morning, Monsieur.

[Baker, spoken]
And where are you off to?

[Belle, spoken]
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story. About a beanstalk and an ogre and a—

[Baker, spoken]
That's nice. Marie! The baguettes! Hurry up!

[Townsfolk, sung]
Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
[Woman:] Never part of any crowd
[Man:] 'Cause her head's up on some cloud
[Townsfolk:] No denying she's a funny girl, that Belle

[Man]
Bonjour!

[Woman]
Good day!

[Man]
How is your family?

[Woman 2]
Bonjour!

[Man 2]
Good day!

[Woman 2]
How is your wife?

[Woman 3]
I need six eggs!

[Man 3]
That's too expensive!

[Belle] There must be more than this provincial life!

[BOOKSTORE OWNER, spoken]
Ah! Belle!

[BELLE, spoken]
Good morning, I've come to return the book I borrowed.

[BOOKSTORE OWNER, spoken]
Finished already?

[BELLE, spoken]
Oh, I couldn't put it down! Have you got anything new?

[BOOKSTORE OWNER, spoken]
Not since yesterday.

[BELLE, spoken]
That's alright. I'll borrow... this one.

[BOOKSTORE OWNER, spoken]
That one? But you've read it twice!

[BELLE, spoken]
It's my favorite. Far-off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise...

[BOOKSTORE OWNER, spoken]
If you like it all that much, it's yours.

[BELLE, spoken]
But sir...

[BOOKSTORE OWNER, spoken]
I insist.

[BELLE, spoken]
Well, thank you! Thank you very much!

[Townsfolk]
Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

[Belle]
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him till chapter three

[Woman]
Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel

[Shopkeeper]
But behind that fair façade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us

[Townsfolk]
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!

(Speaking segment)
[LeFou:] Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston! You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!
[Gaston:] I know.
[LeFou:] No beast alive stands a chance against you -
and no girl, for that matter
[Gaston:] It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sight set on that one
[LeFou:] The inventor's daughter?
[Gaston:] She's the one, the lucky girl I'm going to marry
[LeFou:] But she-
[Gaston:] The most beautiful girl in town
[LeFou:] I know, but-
[Gaston:] That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best?
[LeFou:] But of course! I mean, you do! But I-
(End speaking segment)

[Gaston]
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

[Bimbettes]
Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

[Woman 1:] Bonjour!
[Gaston:] Pardon
[Belle:] Good day
[Woman 2:] Mais oui!
[Woman 3:] You call this bacon?
[Woman 4:] What lovely grapes!
[Man 1:] Some cheese
[Woman 5:] Ten yards!
[Man 1:] One pound
[Gaston:] Excuse me! Please let me through!
[Cheese merchant:] I'll get the knife
[Woman 6:] This bread -
[Woman 7:] Those fish -
[Woman 6:] It's stale!
[Woman 7:] They smell!
[Men:] Madame's mistaken.
[Women:] Well, maybe so
[Townsfolk:] Good morning! Oh, good morning!

[Belle:] There must be more than this provincial life!

[Gaston:] Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

[Townsfolk]
Look there she goes
The girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mad'moiselle!

[Women:] It's a pity and a sin
[Men:] She doesn't quite fit in

[Townsfolk]
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle!

Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

[Man]
Bonjour!

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We pillage plunder, we rifle and loot
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We extort and pilfer, we filch and sack
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
Maraud and embezzle and even highjack
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We kindle and char and in flame and ignite
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
We burn up the city, we're really a fright
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

We're rascals and scoundrels, we're villains and knaves
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
We're devils and black sheep, we're really bad eggs
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We're beggars and blighters and ne'er do-well cads
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho


[Verse 1]
It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hopes and a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all

[Chorus]
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world

[Verse 2]
There is just one moon and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to everyone
Though the mountains divide
And the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all

[Chorus]
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world


[Verse 1:  Céline Dion]
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

[Verse 2: Peabo Bryson & Together]
Just a little change
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

[Verse 3:  Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson]
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson & Together]
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4: Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson & Together]
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

[Verse 5: Peabo Bryson & Céline Dion & Together]
Certain as the sun (Certain as the sun)
Rising in the east (Tale as old as time)
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
(Tale as old as time)
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

[Outro: Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson & Together]
Oh, oh, whoa
Ooh
Beauty and the beast


[DWARFS]
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
In a mine the whole day through
To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
Is what we like to do

It ain't no trick
To get rich quick
If you dig dig dig
With a shovel or a pick
In a mine (In a mine)
In a mine (In a mine)

Where a million diamonds
Shine

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
From early morn to night
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
Up everything in sight

We dig up diamonds
By the score
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more
We don't know what we dig them for
We dig dig dig a-dig dig

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
It's home from work we go
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
It's home from work we go
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho


Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho hum

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
It's home from work we go


Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho

[Verse 1]
You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

[Chorus]
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

[Verse 2]
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we're all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

[Chorus]
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you there he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

[Bridge]
How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down
Then you'll never know

[Chorus]
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind

[Outro]
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind


[Aladdin]
Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
That's everything!

One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

[Guards]
Riffraff!
Street rat!
Scoundrel!
Take that!

[Aladdin]
Just a little snack, guys

[Guards]
Rip him open
Take it back, guys

[Aladdin]
I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts
You're my only friend, Abu!

[Harem Girls]
Who?
Oh, it's sad, Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime

[Harem Manager]
I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em

[Aladdin]
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume

One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

[Guard, Merchant, Aladdin and Woman]
Stop, thief!
Vandal!
Abu!
Scandal!

[Aladdin]
Let's not be too hasty

[Woman]
Still I think he's rather tasty

[Aladdin]
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
(Wrong!)

[Aladdin (and the Guards)]
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
(Vandal!)
One hop ahead of the hump
(Street Rat!)
One trick ahead of disaster
(Scoundrel!)
They're quick, but I'm much faster
(Riffraff!)

Here goes
Better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landing
All I gotta do is jump!


Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

Heal what has been hurt
Change the Fate's design
Save what has been lost
Bring back what once was mine

What once was mine

[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly]
I wanna scream, top of my lungs
Not sitting back, won't hold my tongue
No
Some things are different than we thought
There's more to life than what we're taught
I'm speaking up
Enough's enough

[Pre-Chorus: Meg Donnelly]
'Cause I can't go on this way
I gotta wake up and be brave
But I know I'll face the fire if I say

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly]
I'm gonna stand strong
Nothing's stopping me
I'll be loud
You'll hear me now
I'm gonna stand tall
Take it to the top
I'll be free, can't bring me down
So I'll rise
Won't turn back
I won't hide who I am
I'm gonna stand

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly]
Done living life inside the lines
Following the rules and playing nice
Yeah, I'm stepping up with all my strength
Even if they think it's a mistake
Won't turn my back, I won't close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Meg Donnelly]
On the edge, I'll risk it all
It's worth the chance that I might fall
So I'm not backing down
Believe when I say

[Post-Chorus: Meg Donnelly]
I'm gonna stand
Yeah
I'm gonna stand
Oh

[Bridge: Trevor Tordjman & Meg Donnelly & Both]
How can I just forget
All the things in my head?
Just stand
Oh
You just stand
And if I stand, will I fall
Trying to knock down these walls?
What if I don't know where I stand?
Stand

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly]
I'm gonna stand strong
Nothing's stopping me
I'll be loud
You'll hear me now
I'm gonna stand tall
Take it to the top
I'll be free, can't bring me down
So I'll rise
Won't turn back
I won't hide who I am

I'm gonna stand
Yeah
I'm gonna stand
Yeah
I'm gonna stand
Yeah
I'm gonna stand


[MARY POPPINS]
Do you ever lie
Awake at night?
Just between the dark
And the morning light
Searching for the things
You used to know
Looking for the place
Where the lost things go

Do you ever dream
Or reminisce?
Wondering where to find
What you truly miss
Well maybe all those things
That you love so
Are waiting in the place
Where the lost things go

Memories you've shared
Gone for good you feared
They're all around you still
Though they've disappeared
Nothing's really left
Or lost without a trace
Nothing's gone forever
Only out of place

So maybe now the dish
And my best spoon
Are playing hide and seek
Just behind the moon
Waiting there until
It's time to show
Spring is like that now
Far beneath the snow
Hiding in the place
Where the lost things go

Time to close your eyes
So sleep can come around
For when you dream you'll find
All that's lost is found
Maybe on the moon
Or maybe somewhere new
Maybe all you're missing lives inside of you

So when you need her touch
And loving gaze
Gone but not forgotten
Is the perfect phrase
Smiling from a star
That she makes glow
Trust she's always there
Watching as you grow
Find her in the place
Where the lost things go


[MOANA]
I count the steps from one end of my island to the other
It's a hundred steps from where I sleep to the sea
And when I say I've learned all there is to know
Well there's another little island lesson
Gramma Tala shows me

I know where I am from the scent of the breeze
The ascent of the climb
From the tangle of the trees
From the angle of the mountain
To the sand on our island shore
I've been here before

There's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always more
Someday I'll be out on the sea
And I'm gonna see more
Yes, there's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always—

[VILLAGERS]
Moana, slow down

[MOANA]
Sorry! I'm always in somebody's way
They do the same thing every day
They work, they eat, they sleep, they pray
They tell me

[MOANA and VILLAGERS]
"Moana, calm down!"

[MOANA]
That's all they ever seem to say
The other kids just dance and play
How can you play?
There's so much out there to explore


[PEDDLER]
Oh, I come from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night

Arabian nights, like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways

Arabian nights 'neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes


[Intro: Choir]
Olim
Olim deus accelere
Hoc saeculum splendidum
Accelere fiat venire olim

[Clopin]
Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame

To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city's
The toll of the bells

The bells of Notre Dame

(Speaking)
Listen, they're beautiful, no?
So many colours of sound, so many changing moods
Because you know, they don't ring all by themselves

[Puppet]
- They don't?

[Clopin]
No, silly boy
Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower
Lives the mysterious bell ringer
Who is this creature?

[Puppet]
- Who?

[Clopin]
What is he?

[Puppet]
- What?

[Clopin]
How did he come to be there?

[Puppet]
- How?

[Clopin]
Hush, and Clopin will tell you
It is a tale, a tale of a man and a monster

(Sung)
Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame

[Man #1, spoken]
Shut it up, will you!

[Man #2]
We'll be spotted!

[Woman]
Hush, little one

[Clopin, sung]
Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame

[Man #3, spoken]
Four guilders for safe passage into Paris

[Clopin, sung]
But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells

[Man #1, spoken]
Judge Claude Frollo!

[Clopin, sung]
The bells of Notre Dame

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within

[Frollo, spoken]
Bring these gypsy vermin to the palace of justice

[Guard]
You there, what are you hiding?

[Frollo]
Stolen goods, no doubt. Take them from her

[Clopin]
She ran

[Chorus, sung]
Dies irae, dies illa (Day of wrath, that day)
Solvet saeclum in favilla (Shall consume the world in ashes)
Teste David cum sibylla (As prophesied by David and the sibyl)
Quantus tremor est futurus (What trembling is to be)
Quando Judex est venturus (When the Judge is come)

[Woman, spoken]
Sanctuary, please give us sanctuary!

[Frollo]
A baby? A monster!

[Archdeacon]
Stop!

[Clopin, sung]
Cried the Archdeacon

[Frollo, spoken]
This is an unholy deamon
I am sending it back to Hell, where it belongs

[Archdeacon, sung]
See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

[Frollo, spoken]
I am guiltless. She ran, I pursued

[Archdeacon, sung]
Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

[Frollo, spoken]
My conscience is clear!

[Archdeacon, sung]
You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes

The very eyes of Notre Dame

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
And for one time in his life
Of power and control

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul

[Frollo, spoken]
What must I do?

[Archdeacon]
Care for the child, and raise it as your own

[Frollo]
What? I'm to be saddled with this misshapen...?
Very well. Let him live with you, in your church

[Archdeacon]
Live here? Where?

[Frollo]
Anywhere
(Sung)
Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see

(Spoken)
The bell tower, perhaps
And who knows, our Lord works in mysterious ways

(Sung)
Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

[Clopin, spoken]
And Frollo gave the child a cruel name
A name that means "half-formed":
Quasimodo

(Sung)
Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man?

[Clopin and Chorus]
Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame


[Olaf]
Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
And I’ll be doing whatever snow does in summer
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer
I’ll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm
And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!
And I can’t wait to see, what my buddies all think of me
Just imagine how much cooler I’ll be in summer

Dah dah, da doo, uh bah bah bah bah bah boo

The hot and the cold are both so intense
Put 'em together it just makes sense!

Rrr Raht da daht dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah doo

Winter’s a good time to stay in and cuddle
But put me in summer and I’ll be a——happy snowman!

When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin’ off steam

Oh the sky would be blue, and you guys will be there too
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer

[Kristoff, spoken]
I’m gonna tell him

[Anna, spoken]
Don’t you dare!

[Olaf, spoken]
In summer!​


[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

When Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
Then there's something very wrong
Cause this may be the last time now
That you hear the boogie song, ohhh

[THREE BATS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Ohhh

[SEVEN LIZARDS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Ohhh

[SEVEN LIZARDS]
Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Well if I'm feelin' antsy
And there's nothin' much to do
I might just cook a special batch
Of snake and spider stew
And don't ya know the one thing
That would make it work so nice?
A roly-poly Sandy Claws to add a little spice

[THREE SKELETONS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Oh, yeah

[THREE BATS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Ohhh

[THREE BATS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE, THREE SKELETONS]
Oh, yeah, I'm (he's) the Oogie Boogie Man

[SANTA]
Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny, I'm laughing
You really are too much
And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

[SANTA, spoken]
What are you going to do?

[OOGIE BOOGIE, spoken]
I'm gonna do the best I can

(sung)
Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
When lives are on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

[SANTA]
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere


[Army]
For a long time we've been
Marching off to battle

[Yao]
In our thundering herd
We feel a lot like cattle

[Army]
Like the pounding beat
Our aching feet aren't
Easy to ignore

[Ling]
Hey, think of instead
A girl worth fighting for

[Mulan]
Huh?

[Ling]
That's what I said:
A girl worth fighting for
I want her paler than the
Moon with eyes that
Shine like stars

[Yao]
My girl will marvel at my strength
Adore my battle scars

[Chien Po]
I couldn't care less what she'll wear
Or what she looks like
It all depends on what she cooks like
Beef, pork, chicken
Mmm

[Yao]
Bet the local girls thought
You were quite the charmer

[Ling]
And I'll bet the ladies love
A man in armor

[Army]
You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war

[Ling]
What do we want?

[Army]
A girl worth fighting for

[Yao]
My girl will think I have no faults

[Chien Po]
That I'm a major find

[Mulan]
Uh, how 'bout a girl who's got a brain
Who always speaks her mind?

[Yao, Ling, and Chien Po]
Nah!

[Ling]
My manly ways and turn of
Phrase are sure to thrill her

[Yao]
He thinks he's such a lady killer

[Chi Fu]
I've a girl back home who's
Unlike any other

[Yao]
Yeah, the only girl who'd
Love him is his mother

[Army]
But when we come home
In victory they'll line up
At the door

[Ling]
What do we want?

[Army]
A girl worth fighting for

[Ling]
Wish that I had

[All]
A girl worth fighting for
A girl worth fighting-


[Chorus 1: All & Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Aue aue
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
Aue aue
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home, we know the way

[Chorus 2: All & Opetaia Foa'i]
Aue aue
We are explorers reading every sign
We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain
Aue aue
Te fenua, te mālie
Nā heko hakilia
We know the way


[Verse 1: Jason Evigan]
You better run, run, run
Here we come
Revving our engines under the sun
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'
Woah
Keeping it cool
Smooth and steady
Slicked back hair
Man, things are getting heavy
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Evigan]
Two wheels and an open road
Wrapped in leather
Ready to go

[Chorus: Jason Evigan]
Don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way

[Verse 2: Grace Phipps]
Bubblegum, cherry pop
Go to the hop
Hanging with my brother cuz' his friends are so hot
While they're cruisin' for some bruisin'

[Verse 3: Ross Lynch]
Alright
I went to the drive in and what did I see?
A hundred little betties all staring at me!
I was cruisin' for some lovin'!

[Pre-Chorus: Ross Lynch]
I got these two wheels and an open road
So, pop that clutch, I'm ready to go!

[Chorus: Ross Lynch]
Don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way

[Bridge: Ross Lynch]
Oh, it goes 1, 2, 1, 2, 3
A-who, who, who's ridin with me?
I've got a gang full of brusiers, all crusin' with me
And we're tearin' up, we're tearin' up, we're tearin' up the streets
Oh

[Chorus: Ross Lynch, Grace Phipps, & Jason Evigan]
Don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way

So don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way
No, we're not gonna live any other way
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way
Oh


[Verse 1: Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen]
I can see what's happening (I can't, what?)
And they don't have a clue (Who's they?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two (Oh, I get it)
The sweet caress of twilight (Yep)
There's magic everywhere (It's everywhere)
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Donald Glover]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

[Verse 2: Donald Glover]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible
She'd turn away from me

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Donald Glover]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

[Outro: Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed


[Verse 1]
I feel like I've been locked in tight 
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
Thinking of rain blowing kisses my way
That don't mean I'm gonna hear what you say
Baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, woah (my mind is saying let's go)
Oh, woah, woah (but my heart is saying no)

[Chorus]
If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I've gotta like what you do
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

[Verse 2]
The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who gets me
Heart is racing at the speed of light
Let's go and have a little fun tonight
Baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, woah (my mind is saying let's go)
Oh, woah, woah (but my heart is saying no)

[Chorus]
If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
I'll be with you
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

[Bridge]
Oh, woah, woah
(My mind is saying let's go)
Oh woah, woah
(But my heart is saying no)

[Chorus: Breakdown]
If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby


[Intro: Thomas Doherty]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Dove Cameron, Booboo Stewart, Sofia Carson, Cameron Boyce]
They  say I'm trouble, they say I’m bad
Fire  in my belly, so don't make me mad
A dirty no-good, down to the bone
I'll take that trophy, back to my zone
So  I’ve got some mischief in my blood
My  fashion's wicked? Hands off my gloves
They think I'm callous, a low-life hood
The  times are changing, bad is the new good (Ha ha ha ha)

[Pre-Chorus: Dove Cameron and Sofia Carson]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

[Chorus 1: All]
I'm  rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the core, I’m rotten to the
I’m rotten to the core

[Verse 2: China Anne, Thomas Doherty, Sarah Jeffery, Jadah Marie, •All•]
(Yeah)
Long as I'm leader, of this lost isle
There’ll always be a little evil, behind my smile
Don't double cross me, I'll get you hooked (Ha ha ha ha)
You think I'm kidding? Just take a look
I’m not a sweetheart, I'm not your friend
But you better invite me, or taste revenge
I'm on the hustle, take what I can get
Show me the money
•You ain't seen nothing yet• (Ha ha ha ha ha)

[Pre-Chorus: Girls]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 2: All]
I'm rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more? (For more)
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the (Ahh!), I'm rotten to the (Woo!)
I'm rotten to the core, core (Ahh!)
Rotten to the core (Hey, hey)
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the core


[ELLIE]
Just one day, that's all I need
Just a day without her nagging
Just one day, I beg, I plead
But the drag just keeps on dragging

While I wish for just one Monday or a Friday to be free
Free to slouch and sulk and mumble and be messy and be me
All I ask is for twelve hours to live my life my way
Just one simple, awesome, crazy, kickass day

One more day, she's on my back
She's been riding me forever
On my faults, and all I lack
And all I, oh, whatever

'Cause I'm lazy and I'm average and I'm sloppy for a start
And I know she'd like a daughter who was pretty, thin, and smart
And I know she's frickin' perfect, but I'll never be that way
Not for a single, solitary day

[KATHERINE]
Tomorrow is the wedding and tonight is the rehearsal
And there is no room for error, I mean not one flaw
We've got guests in just ten hours
Dress the tables, trim the flowers
I want beauty and perfection
I want total awe

[TORREY]
And with Weddings Magazine here for a feature on the scene here
The business is depending on this one success

[KATHERINE]
Now breathe, but thank you, Torrey
And in fact, that is the story
So get moving, move this produce and remove this mess

Just one day is all I want
With my family united
Fears at bay
No fights, no taunts
Just the four of us delighted

I mean, look, I love my kids, I love my work, I love my life
And I love my fiancé and in a day, I'll be his wife
And I'll throw the perfect wedding and I'll throw the bride's bouquet
And we'll have one happy, loving, family day

[ELLIE, spoken]
Mother, Fletcher is puppeting me again!

[KATHERINE]
One more day, she'll fight and fuss
When her joy is all I'm after
It's been a long, tough time for us
Now it's time to hear some laughter

'Cause I only want her happy and well, punctual and clean
But she mumbles and she grumbles and at time she's upright mean
She's bright and so insightful, but those traits aren't on display
Well, not lately, often, ever, not today

[ELLIE, spoken]
Ok, really fast, tonight is The Hunt. It's an epic scavenger hunt and I really wanna win. There's just one issue...

[ELLIE, sung]
Just one day, that's all I seek
And I have been asking nicely
Just one day, it's not a week
It's a night to speak precisely

And The Hunt is not a stunt, it's my one shot at fame
To be someone who is something, not just what's-her-name
If I'm in it, I can win it, if she'd only say ok
We'd be off and running, gunning for one fun and perfect day

(Several people are talking to Katherine)

[ELLIE, spoken]
Mom. Mom. MOM!

[KATHERINE]
Ellie dear, it's not the time
No, that apron is a crime
And that sea bass isn't fresh, it's three days dead

[ELLIE]
Mom, I really need to know if I can-
Wait, now where'd she go?
God, I'll never draw her focus from the bread

[KATHERINE]
It's a million little things
From the racing to the rings
But I got this
'Cause I love to work this way

[ELLIE]
Mom it's just a little game
Just a silly little game
And I wouldn't even play

[MIKE]
[?]
But really who can tell?
It's okay
It's okay

[ALL]
Just one day that's all we get
Til the vows, the hunt, the story
Just one day, sunrise sunset
Then the night in all its glory

[KATHERINE (& ELLIE)]
Just say the word and she'll (we'll) be on our way
We're on our way
In just one day
For one
Stressful!

[ELLIE]
Perfect!

[KATHERINE]
Busy!

[ELLIE]
Winning!

[KATHERINE]
Anxious!

[ELLIE]
Stellar!

[KATHERINE]
High Stakes!

[ELLIE]
Kickass!

[KATHERINE]
Do or die

[ALL]
Crazy day!


[MARY POPPINS]
John, you're right
It's good to know you're bright
For intellect can wash away confusion
Georgie sees
And Annabel agrees
Most folderol's an optical illusion
You three know it's true
That one plus one is two
Yes, logic is the rock of our foundation
I suspect, and I'm never incorrect
That you're far too old to give into imagination

No, not yet!

Some people like to splash and play
Can you imagine that?
And take a seaside holiday
Can you imagine that?
Too much glee leaves rings around the brain
Take that joy and send it down the drain

Some people like to laugh at life
And giggle through the day
They think the world's a brand new shiny toy
And if while dreaming in the clouds
They fall and go kersplat
Although they're down and bent in half
They brush right off and start to laugh
Can you imagine that?

On second thoughts, perhaps you're right. It makes no sense to take a bath this early

[GEORGIE]
Wait. I want to take a bath!

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, really? Up you go and in you go!

[JOHN]
Georgie!

[ANNABEL]
What happened? Will they be alright?!

[MARY POPPINS]
Well, it is just a bath, after all. But then again, it's not my tub

[ANNABEL]
Shouldn't you go in after them?

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, no. I had my bath this morning, thank you

[ANNABEL]
Well if you won't, I will! Woah!

[MARY POPPINS]
Off we go!

[instrumental]

[MARY POPPINS]
Some people like to dive right in
Can you imagine that?
And flap about in bathtub gin
Can you imagine that?
Doggies paddling twenty leagues below
Might seem real but we know
It's not so
To cook without a recipe
Can you imagine that?
And heaven knows what lives within that pot
Some pirates follow treasure maps
And wear a silly hat
They search the world for buried gold
They won't grow up and don't grow old
Can you imagine that?

Be sure to scrub behind your ears!

[instrumental]

[MARY POPPINS]
Some answer when adventure calls

[ALL]
Can you imagine that?

[MARY POPPINS]
And sail straight over waterfalls

[ALL]
Can you imagine that?

[MARY POPPINS]
They see living as it's own reward

[ADMIRAL BOOM]
Ahoy!

[MARY POPPINS]
They rock the boat, then --

[ADMIRAL BOOM]
Man overboard!

[MARY POPPINS]
Some people look out on the sea
And see a brand new day
Their spirit lifts them high above the blue
Yet some others wear an anchor
And they sink in seconds flat
So, perhaps we've learned when day is done
Some stuff and nonsense could be fun

[ALL]
Can you im-a-gine that?

So wait
There's no mountain too great
Hear the words and have faith
(Oh, oh, iyo)
Have faith!

He lives in you
(Hela hey mamela, hela)
He lives in me
(Hela hey mamela, hela)
He watches over
(Hela hey mamela, hela)
Everything we see

Into the truth
In your reflection
(Hela hey mamela)
He lives in you

He lives in you
Whoo!

He lives in me
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Hela hey mamela, hela)
He watches over

Everything we see

(Hela hey mamela, hela)
Into the water
(Hela hey mamela, hela)
Whoo!
Into the truth
(Hela hey mamela, hela)
In your reflection
He lives in you

Ingonyama nengw' enamabala
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala
(He lives in you)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala
(He lives in you)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala
(He lives in you)


[PINOCCHIO]
I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret, or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free
There are no strings on me

Hi-ho the merry-o
That's the only way to be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me

I've got no strings so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings, but you can see
There are no strings on me

[DUTCH MARIONETTE]
You have no strings, your arms is free
To love me by the Zeider Zee
Ya, ya, ya, if you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you

[FRENCH MARIONETTE]
You got no strings, couci couca
Your savoir faire is oo-la-la
I've got strings, but entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you

[RUSSIAN MARIONETTE]
Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendez-vous
Where me and Ivan goes
But I'd rather go with you, hey

[PINOCCHIO]
There are no strings on me


[LUMIÈRE, spoken]
Ma chère Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents: your dinner!

(sung)
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest

Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious
Don't believe me? Ask the dishes

They can sing, they can dance
After all, Miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest!

Beef ragout
Cheese soufflé
Pie and pudding, en flambé
We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret!
You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes! I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

[Hook]
And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be our guest
If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!
Get your worries off your chest
Let us say for your entree
We've an array; may we suggest:
Try the bread! Try the soup!
When the croutons loop de loop
It's a treat for any dinner
Don't belive me? Ask the china
Singing pork! Dancing veal!
What an entertaining meal!
How could anyone be gloomy and depressed?
We'll make you shout "encore!"
And send us out for more
So, be our guest!
Lumiere:
Be our guest!
Chorus:
Be our guest!

[Mrs. Potts]
It's a guest! It's a guest!
Sake's alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do!
Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest!
(She's our guest!)
She's our guest!
(Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!)

[Lumiere]
Life is so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ah, those good old days when we were useful...
Suddenly those good old days are gone
Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills!
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!

[Hook]
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Our command is your request
It's been years since we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you, we'll keep going

[Lumiere with Hook]
Course by course, one by one
'Til you shout, "Enough! I'm done!"
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest!
Be our guest!
Be our guest!
Please, be our guest!


[Pre-Chorus: All]
Good, bad, dark, light
What you rather be tonight?

[Verse 1: Brenna D'Amico & Sofia Carson]
Would you rather
Eat a bad apple and sleep for a week
Or break up with your prince?

Would you rather
Ride to the ball in a pumpkin and fall
Or go out with him? Ew!

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Good, bad, dark, light
What you rather be tonight?

[Chorus: All]
Doesn't matter what we do, cause I'd rather be with you
Rather be with you
Rather be with you

Doesn't matter who is who, cause I'd rather be with you
Rather be with you
Rather be with you

[Verse 2: Dove Cameron & Lauryn McClain]
Would you rather
Give a big smooch to a frog
Or drop your phone, into a bog? No!

Would you rather
Sing with a squirrel while you twirl
Or have a zit? (Ugh!) End of the world

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Good, bad, dark light
What you rather be tonight?

[Chorus: All]
Doesn't matter what we do, cause I'd rather be with you
Rather be with you
Rather be with you

Doesn't matter who is who, cause I'd rather be with you
Rather be with you
Rather be with you

[Bridge: All]
You-oo, you-oo
I'd rather be with you
You-oo, you-oo
I'd rather be with you
You-oo, you-oo
I'd rather be with you
You-oo, You-oo

[Break: All]
Would you rather wear a shoe made of glass?
Or fall asleep in your class?
Be grounded under the sea?
Or help the beast with his fleas?
Take 100 dalmatians
On a three-week vacation

[Spoken: Brenna D'Amico,  Lauryn McClain, and Dove Cameron]
Prick your finger on a spindle?
Um, what's a spindle?
Ugh!

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Good, bad, dark, light
What you rather be tonight?

[Chorus: All]
Doesn't matter what we do, cause I'd rather be with you
Rather be with you
Rather be with you

Doesn't matter who is who, cause I'd rather be with you
Rather be with you
Rather be with you

[Bridge: All]
You-oo, you-oo
I'd rather be with you
You-oo, you-oo
I'd rather be with you
You-oo, you-oo
I'd rather be with you


[1. Strophe]
Wieder zieht es mich zum Meer
Seh zum Horizont ich spür dieses Fernweh
Kann es einfach nicht versteh'n
Ich wär gerne die perfekte Tochter
Doch starre ich nur auf das Wasser
Will es mir nicht eingesteh'n
Ich kenn jeden Weg, jede Lichtung hier
Jeder Schritt von mir führt mich wieder her
Doch ich kann nicht fort, nicht zu jenem Ort, der die Sehnsucht weckt

[Refrain]
Wo das Meer sich verliert schwebt ein Klang
Er ruft mich
Ist es denn weit bin ich bereit
Wenn der Wind und das Meer sich mit mir dann verbünden
Es kommt die Zeit
Wenn ich geh, dann wird sich zeigen, wie weit ich komm

[Strophe 2]
Ich weiß jeder hier auf dieser Insel
Ist sehr glücklich auf der Insel
Alles hier ist so perfekt
Ich weiß jeder hier auf dieser Insel
Ist für sie unentbehrlich
Find ich den Platz für mich
Gehe stolz voran und ich mach uns stark
Und ich freu mich, dass ich bei euch sein kann
Doch etwas in mir zieht mich fort von hier
Was ist los mit mir

[Bridge]
Dieses Licht das da scheint auf dem Meer - es blendet
Ist es denn weit bin ich bereit
Und es scheint eine Stimme ruft ganz laut
Komm doch zu mir - jetzt ist es Zeit
Zeige mir den Ort hinter'm Horizont

[Refrain]
Wo das Meer sich verliert schwebt ein Klang
Er ruft mich
Ist es denn weit bin ich bereit
Wenn der Wind und das Meer sich mit mir dann verbünden
Dann ist es Zeit ich bin bereit


[Letra de "Callar (Versión Completa)]

[Verse 1]
Ese mar viene y me quiere llevar
Con olas que ahogan mi aliento
Por su razón, debo todo ocultar
Mi voz se extingue en el trueno

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No he de llorar
No he de derrumbarme
Los mueve intentar
Callarme y vencerme ya

[Chorus]
Silencio nunca
Desean que enmudezca
Y que tiemble con la idea
Y callar no será mi vida
No acepto
Que tratan de sofocarme
Déjen de subestimarme
El callar, no será mi vida

[Verse 2]
Siglos de reglas
Y absurda verdad
Que se han escrito en piedra
Quédate inmóvil
Y no hables jamás
Adiós a esta leyenda

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Y yo
No quiero derrumbarme
Los llamo a intentar
A callarme y vencerme ya

[Chorus]
Silencios nunca
Desean que enmudzca
No tiemblo con la idea
Y callar, no será mi vida , vida
Los recibo
Firme como roca
No han de cerrar mi boca
Y callar, no será mi vida

[Verse 3]
Creen que me van a enjaular
No lograrán mi rendición
Mis alas rotas
Pero entera en llamas vuelo hacia el sol
Sus acciones mi voz

[Chorus]
No amedrentan
Si quieren creer que tiemblo con la idea
El callar, no será mi vida , vida
No acepto
Que tratan de sofocarme
Dejen de subestimarme
El callar, no será mi vida

[Outro]
El callar, no será mi vida , vida


[Verse 1]
Now, I'm the king of the swingers, uh
The jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what's botherin' me
I wanna be a man, man-cub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around

[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Human too

[Verse 2]
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub
And don't get in a stew
What I desire is man's red fire
So I can be like you
Now gimme the secret, man-cub
Just clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
And make my dreams come true

[Verse 3]
Now I will ape your mannerisms
And we'll be a set of twins
No one will know
Where man-cub ends and orangutan begins
And when I eat bananas
I won't peel them with my feet
'Cause I'll become a man
Man-cub and learn some etiquette

[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Human too

[Outro]
Can learn to be
Human too
I wanna be like you
I wanna feel human, too


[Verse 1]
Boys and girls of every age
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
Come with us and you will see
This, our town of Halloween

This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene
Trick or treat until the neighbors going to die of fright
It's our town, everybody scream
In this town of Halloween

I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under yours stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair

[Chorus]
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween

[Verse 2]
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise

Round that corner, man hiding in the trash can
Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll scream
This is Halloween, red and black, slimy green
Aren't you scared? Well, that's just fine

Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream, everybody scream
In our town of Halloween

I am the clown with the tear away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the who when you call, who's there?
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright

[Chorus]
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

[Verse 3]
Tender lumplings everywhere
Life's no fun without a good scare
That's our job, but we're not mean
In our town of Halloween

In this town, don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise

Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin
This is Halloween, everybody scream
Won't you please make way for a very special guy?

Our man jack is king of the Pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King, now

[Chorus]
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween

In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la


[KRISTOFF]
Reindeers are better than people
Sven, don't you think that's true?

(As Sven)
Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you
Every one of them's bad except you

(As himself)
Oh, thanks buddy
But people smell better than reindeers
Sven, don't you think I'm right?

(As Sven)
That's once again true
For all except you

(As himself)
You got me, let's call it a night

(As Sven)
Good night

(As himself)
Don't let the frostbite
Bite...


[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
Once there was a Princess -

[DOC, spoken]
Was the Princess you?

[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
And she fell in love -

[SNEEZY, spoken]
Was it hard to do?

[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
Well, it was very easy. Anyone could see that the Prince was charming. The only one for me

[DOC, spoken]
Was he strong and handsome?

[SNEEZY, spoken]
Was he big and tall?

[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
There's nobody like him. Anywhere at all

[BASHFUL, spoken]
Did he say he loved ya?

[HAPPY, spoken]
Did he steal a kiss?

[SNOW WHITE sung]
He was so romantic
I could not resist

Someday my prince will come
Someday we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know

Someday when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing and wedding bells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true


[Verse 1: Kingston Foster & Meg Donnelly & Both]
Been waiting for this day to come
And it was all so clear
Since I was a little girl
I saw me standing here
All the times they told me "Walk away"
I said "Forget it"
You know where you are headed
And we are gonna get it

[Verse 2: Milo Manheim & Kylee Russell & Both]
Taking it right to the top
We ain't got no doubts
Together we can build it up
Can you hear us now?
Yeah, we see the future
It's looking really bright
Yeah, that's where we're headed
And we know how to get it

[Pre-Chorus: All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Chorus: Milo Manheim & Meg Donnelly]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up

[Pre-Chorus: Trevor Tordjman & All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Chorus: All]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up
[gasps]
Oh! That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me!
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
[cheering]


[SCAT CAT]
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat
Who knows where it's at

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Tell me
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat
'Cause everything else is obsolete

[SCAT CAT, spoken]
Strictly high-button shoes!

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born

[SCAT CAT]
Ever'time he plays

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
But with a square in the act
You can set music back

[SCAT CAT]
To the cave man days
Cha-cha-ba-dum-bo-day

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing

[SCAT CAT]
Still a cat's the only cat who knows how to swing

[BILLY BOSS]
Who wants to dig a long-haired gig and stuff like that?

[SCAT CAT, THOMAS O'MALLEY]
When everybody wants to be a cat

A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born
Ever'time he plays

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky

[SCAT CAT, THOMAS O'MALLEY]
With a square in the act, you can set music back
To the cave man days

[MARIE]
Oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Yes

[MARIE, THOMAS O'MALLEY & SCAT CAT]
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
While playin' jazz you always has a welcome mat
'Cause everybody digs a swingin' cat

[DUCHESS]
If you want to turn me on
Play your horn, don't spare the tone
And blow a little soul into the tune

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Let's take it to another key

[SCAT CAT]
Modulate, and wait for me
I'll take a few ad-libs and pretty soon

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
The other cats will all commence
Congregatin' on the fence
Beneath the alley's only light

[DUCHESS]
Where every note is out of sight

[ALLEY CATS]
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Hallelujah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (I'm telling you!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Yeah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Mmm)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Hallelujah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat...


[Intro: Dove Cameron & Sofia Carson]
(You ready?)
Oh, oh, uh-yeah
Uh-uhhh
(Let's go)

[Verse 1: Dove Cameron & Sofia Carson]
Don't have to win the gold all on your own
We're a team, now we're stronger
Don't gotta face whole world all alone
'Cause we can go further

[Pre-Chorus: Sofia Carson (Both)]
(The road could be hard and the night could be dark
Like a jewel, we'll shine brightly wherever we are)
If we stick to the dream, we'll never fall apart

[Chorus: Both]
Because we're better together, stronger side-by-side
This is the moment, it's our time
So we're different, whatever
Everyone can shine
This is the moment of our lives, 'cause we're better together

[Verse 2: Dove Cameron & Sofia Carson
Everyone of us is more than strong enough
But when we work together (we work together)
We're a power that nothing else can touch
Every piece makes us better

[Pre-Chorus: Dove Cameron (Both)]
(The road could be hard and the night could be dark
Like a jewel, we'll shine brightly wherever we are)
If we stick to the dream, we'll never fall apart (fall apart)

[Chorus: Both]
Because we're better together, stronger side-by-side
This is the moment, it's our time
So we're different, whatever
Everyone can shine
This is the moment of our lives, 'cause we're better together

[Bridge: Both]
We are stronger
All of us together
Only makes us better (yeah)
We can do whatever
We are stronger (we're stronger)
All of us together (together)
Only makes us better
We can do whatever
Yeah!

[Chorus: Both]
Because we're better together, stronger side-by-side
This is the moment, it's our time
So we're different, whatever
Everyone can shine
This is the moment of our lives, 'cause we're better together

[Outro: Both (Sofia Carson)]
We are stronger (oh, oh)
All of us together (oh, oh)
Only makes us better (oh, oh)
We can do whatever (oh, oh)
We are stronger (oh, oh)
All of us together (oh, oh)
Only makes us better (oh, oh)
We can do whatever (oh, oh)
'Cause we're better together


This is what you give me to work with?
Well, honey, I've seen worse
We're going to turn this sow's ear
Into a silk purse

We'll have you washed and dried
Primped and polished
Till you glow with pride
Trust my recipe for instant bride
You'll bring honor to us all

Wait and see
When we're through
Boys will gladly go to war for you
With good fortune
And a great hairdo
You'll bring honor to us all

A girl can bring her family
Great honor in one way
By striking a good match
And this could be the day

Men want girls with good taste
Calm
Obedient
Who work fast-paced
With good breeding
And a tiny waist
You'll bring honor to us all

We all must serve our Emperor
Who guards us from the Huns
A man by bearing arms
A girl by bearing sons

When we're through
You can't fail
Like a lotus blossom
Soft and pale
How could any fellow
Say "No Sale"
You'll bring honor to us all

There, you're ready
Not yet
An apple for serenity
A pendant for balance
Beads of jade for beauty
You must proudly show it
Now add a cricket just for luck
And even you can't blow it

Ancestors
Hear my plea
Help me not to make a
Fool of me
And to not uproot
My family tree
Keep my father standing tall

Scarier than the undertaker
We are meeting our matchmaker
Destiny
Guard our girls
And our future
As it fast unfurls
Please look kindly on
These cultured pearls
Each a perfect porcelain doll

Please bring honor to us
Please bring honor to us
Please bring honor to us
Please bring honor to us
Please bring honor to us all


Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one when you play
Don't you mind what you say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

From your head to your toes
You're so sweet goodness knows
You are so precious to me
Cute as can be, baby of mine


[GISELLE]
When you meet the someone who was meant for you
Before two can become one, there's something you must do

[ANIMALS]
Do you pull each others tails? Do you feed each other seeds?

[GISELLE]
No, there is something sweeter everybody needs...
I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss
And a prince I'm hoping comes with this
That's what brings ever-after so happy
And that's the reason we need lips so much
For lips are the only things that touch
So to spend a life of endless bliss
Just find who you love through true love's kiss

[ANIMALS]
She's been dreaming of a true love's kiss
And a prince she's hoping comes with this
That's what brings ever-aftering so happy, so happy
And that's the reason we need lips so much
For lips are the only things that touch...

[GISELLE]
So to spend a life of endless bliss
Just find who you love through true love's kiss

[PRINCE EDWARD]
You're the fairest maid I've ever met
You were made

[GISELLE]
To finish your duet

[BOTH]
And in years to come we'll reminisce

[PRINCE EDWARD]
How we came to love

[GISELLE]
And grew and grew love

[BOTH]
Since first we knew love through true love's kiss

[JACK]
When the early morning hours have come and gone
Through the misty morning showers
I greet the dawn
For when its light has hit the ground
There's lots of treasures to be found
Underneath the lovely London sky

Though the lamps I’m turning down
Please don't feel blue
For in this part of London town
The light shines through
Don't believe the things you’ve read
You never know what's up ahead
Underneath the lovely London sky

Have a pot of tea
Mend your broken cup
There's a different point of view
Awaiting you
If you would just look up
I know

Yesterday you had to borrow from your chums
Seems the promise of tomorrow never comes
But since you dreamed the night away
Tomorrow's here
It's called today
So count your blessings
You're a lucky guy
For you're underneath the lovely London sky

Listen
Soon this slump will disappear
It won't be long
Sooner than you think you’ll hear
Some bright new song
So hold on tight to those you love
And maybe soon from up above
You’ll be blessed so keep on looking high
While you're underneath the lovely London sky
Lovely London sky


I know it might be crazy
But did you hear the story?
I think I heard it vaguely
A girl and a zombie
Oh, tell me more, boy
Sounds like a fantasy
Oh, what could go so wrong
With a girl and a zombie

You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darker side
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me
Right from the start you caught my eye
And something inside me came to life
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me

Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say

We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday


[Letra de "Un Mundo Ideal (Versión Créditos)"]

[Verse 1: ZAYN]
I can show you the world: shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride

[Chorus: ZAYN & Becky G]
A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "no," or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
Un mundo ideal
Tan deslumbrante y nuevo hoy
Donde ya vi al subir, con claridad
Que ahora en un mundo ideal estoy
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

[Verse 2: Becky G]
Fabulosa visión
Sentimiento divino
Baja y sube
Y vuela hacia celestial region

[Chorus: ZAYN & Becky G, Both]
Un mundo ideal (Don't you dare close your eyes)
Allí mil cosas voy a ver (Hold your breath; it gets better)
Soy como azul estrella... que se va
Y nunca será igual ya otra vez
A whole new world, with new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: ZAYN & Becky G, Both]
Un mundo ideal (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
Nadie que diga "No"
O a donde ir
A aquello que se aman
A whole new world (Cada vuelta es sorpresa)
With new horizons to pursue (Cada instante un retrato)
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Anywhere, ooh, ooh (There's time to spare)
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Chorus: ZAYN & Becky G, Both]
Un mundo ideal (A whole new world)
Que compartir (That's where we'll be)
Que alcanzar (A wondrous place)
For you and me


[ANNABEL]
Turning turtle? What exactly does that mean?

[TOPSY]
It means my whole world goes flippity-flop like a turtle on its back. And I don't know my up from my down, my east from my west, my topsy from my bottomsy!

If you ring with something broken on a Thursday
I'll make new, with my glue, pins and thread
What you bring -- when I've awoken -- on a Friday
I will mend and then spend the day in bed
Children, Satur, Sun and Mondays are just everything is fun days
But in the second week, I wear a frown
For, I know that after Tuesday comes the Topsy get's bad news day
It's the dreaded second Wednesday
When from 9 to noon, my life turns upside down

Fast is slow, low is high, stop is go and that is why
Every second Wednesday is a hurdle
From 8 to 9, all is well
Then I roll over on my shell
And all because the world is turning turtle

Day is night, dog is cat, black is white, thin is fat
That is why I'm loosening up my girdle
I cannot help this charming troop
Don't mock me, 'cause I'm in the soup
And why? Because the world is turning turtle

Oh, woe is me, I'm as opposite as I can be
I long for Thursdays when the world is drab
When will it cease? Now my life resembles War and Peace
That Tolstoy certainly had the gift of gab, I couldn't get through it!

Bottom's top, yin is yang, peace and quiet's Sturm und Drang
Tuesday nights, my blood begins to curdle
East is west, in is out, and that is why I need to shout
"Oh no!" The world is turning turtle

Oh, if you had come some other morn'
You wouldn't have found me so forlorn
But, since the day that I was born
Second Wednesdays is on the fritz
I couldn't mend this to save my soul
If this keeps up, I'll dig a hole
You say life's a cherry bowl
But Wednesday's full of pits

[JACK]
Tell us, can you fix this drum?

[TOPSY]
Well, today it's looking glum

[JOHN]
Can you mend this crack?

[ANNABEL]
And broken string?

[TOPSY]
Perhaps, if you all lend a hand

[JACK and CHILDREN]
Our fingers are at your command

[MARY POPPINS]
A broken songbird still can sing

[TOPSY]
Let's do the turtle swing!

[instrumental]

[TOPSY]
Oh, woe is me
Now I'm on my head!
How can that be?

[MARY POPPINS]
Well you say woe, but I say lucky you

[TOPSY]
Lucky me?

[MARY POPPINS]
Yes. Here on your head, "A" is far behind and led by Zed
It's good to get a different point of view

You see, when the world turns upside down, the best thing is turn right along with it

[TOPSY]
I do see! From down here, things look right side up, hahaha!

[JACK]
I wouldn't mind seeing things from that angle

[JOHN]
Sounds like fun

[ANNABEL]
Can we?

[MARY POPPINS]
Very well. Flippity flop

[ANNABEL]
Near is

[JOHN]
Far is

[JACK]
Here is

[GEORGIE]
There!

[MARY POPPINS]
Turtles turning everywhere!

[TOPSY]
Things are getting clear

[MARY POPPINS]
Well, knock on wood, my dear!
When you change the view from where you stood
The things you view will change for good

[TOPSY]
I never thought of things that way

[MARY POPPINS]
She never thought of things that way

[TOPSY]
Now Wednesdays are my favorite day

[JACK and CHILDREN]
Now Wednesdays are her favorite day

[TOPSY]
'Cause that's the day I'm quite contrary
And now, thanks to cousin Mary
I have changed- to be exact
I love the fact

[ALL]
The world is turning turtle, turtle, turtle!


[Verse 1: Peabo Bryson]
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, Princess, now when did you last
Let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Chorus 1: Peabo Bryson]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Chorus 2: Regina Belle]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

[Verse 2: Regina Belle]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Chorus 3: Regina (and Peabo)]
A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be

[Chorus 4: Peabo and Regina]
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you, ohh

[Guitar Solo with vocalizations]

[Chorus 5: Regina (and Peabo)]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Chorus 6: Peabo (and Regina)]
A whole new world
(Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment, red letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
(Anywhere) There's time to spare
(Let me share)
This whole new world with you

[Outro: Regina (and Peabo)]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
That's where we'll be (Where we will be)
A thrilling chase (A wondrous place)
For you and me


A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for, you keep

Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

(spoken)
Oh, that clock!  Old killjoy.  I hear you, come on, get up you say!  Time to start another day!  Even he orders me around.  Well, there's one thing - they can't order me to stop dreaming.  And perhaps, someday -

(sung)
The dreams that I wish will come true

(vocalizing with mice)

No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true


The wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is Tiggers are wonderful things
Thier tops are made out of rubbers
Their bottoms are made out fo springs
They're bouncy, trouncy, founcy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is
I'm the only one
The wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is Tiggers are wonderful chaps
They're loaded with vim and with vigor
And love to leap in your laps
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is
I'm the only one
Tiggers are wonderful fellahs
Tiggers are awfully sweet
Everyone else is jealous
And that's why I repeat...
(Repeat first)


[Opening Music]

[JACK]
What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air

What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack this isn't fair
What's this?

What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this? What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
Instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look

What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire

What's this? What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think?
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now correct me if I'm wrong

This looks like fun, this looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them
Only little cozy things, secure inside their dreamland
(Sigh)
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems
To be good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me has been filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it oh, I want it oh
I want it for my own
I've got to know, I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
Christmas Town? Hmm...


[KATHERINE]
I'm ace at all anatomies and master of dissection
An expert chef who wields an expert knife
But still, I sense a gremlin in the system of perfection
There clearly are still mysteries to life
It's kingdom, phylum, class, and then
It's order, family, genus
It all comes back to me like child's play
Then he leans over my shoulder there, in all his long and leanness
And cuts my hard earned knowledge clean away
I try to keep a focused mind and steady hand

[STUDENTS]
Ooh, keep focused, ooh, keep steady

[KATHERINE]
But the rhythm of my heart is like a country western band

[STUDENTS]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[KATHERINE]
Oh, biology!
What have you done to me?
Why can't my grown-up brain control my teenage parts?

Oh, biology!
Why won't you let me be?
Why can't you be humane and still our beating hearts?
Before the cutting starts

[ADAM, spoken]
Huh, shyeah. Ellie, check it. Hahaha, man!

[KATHERINE and STUDENTS)]
He's inert and inarticulate (Ooh)
A specimen of truant (Ooh)
And though we're both fifteen, he's much too young (Ooh)

[STUDENTS]
Much too young

[KATHERINE]
My amygdala is fully formed, my frontal lobe is fluent (Ooh, ooh)
And pheromones go futzing with my tongue

[ADAM]
That's totes amaze, I'm way impressed, like, sweet technique

[STUDENTS]
Holy cow!

[KATHERINE]
Um, like totally, um, thanks
Good lord, now can't I even speak?

[KATHERINE and STUDENTS]
Oh, biology! (Oh, biology!)
What have you done to me? (Done to me!)
My over-forty soul is in a teen cliche (Teen cliche!)
Oh, biology! (Biology!)
Why won't you set me free? (Set me free!)
'Cause I'm not in control and hunger has its say (Hunger has its say)
And hormones have their way

(spoken)
Focus Blake, focus

[ZACH]
Hey, take a look at Ellie Blake
She does this lab work great

[LIAM]
For Kermit there, he had no chance

[SAVANNAH]
That girl is on my nerves today, I better set her straight

[RUSTY]
It's fun to make a dead frog dance!

[ADAM]
I never knew that Ellie Blake was such a science wiz
She's smart, of course, so it makes sense
But something's up with her today, I don't know what it is
She's like on fire, she's so intense

[LORI]
He's so intense!

[STUDENTS]
It's so intense!

[RUSTY]
And I'm so dense!

[KATHERINE & ALL]
Oh, biology!
Look what you've done to me!
My heart is in a pan, my brain is out to sea
Oh, biology!
Why won't you let me be?
Please help me if you can, please hear my painful plea
Biology
Biology
Biology

[KATHERINE]
Please set me free

[STUDENTS]
Set me free
Set me free
Set her free

[BALLOON LADY]
Life's a balloon
That tumbles or rises
Depending on what is inside
Fill it with hope
And playful surprises
And oh, dearie ducks
Then you're in for a ride

Look inside the balloon
And if you hear a tune
There's nowhere to go but up
Choose the secret we know
Before life makes us grow
There's nowhere to go but up

If your selection feels right
Well then deary, hold tight
If you see your reflection
Your heart will take flight
If you pick the right string
Then your heart will take wing
And there's nowhere to go but up!

[instrumental]

[MICHAEL]
Now I feel like that boy
With a shiny new toy
And there's nowhere to go but up

[JANE]
Michael!

[MICHAEL]
Just one day at the fair
Has me waltzing on air
And there's nowhere to go but up

Jane, I remember. It's all true, every impossible thing we imagined with Mary Poppins -- it all happened!

Now my heart is so light
That I think I just might
Start feeding the birds
And then go fly a kite
With your head in a cloud
Only laughter's allowed
And there's nowhere to go but up

[instrumental]

[JOHN, ANNABEL, and GEORGIE]
We're zigging and zagging
Our feet never dragging
We might take a ride to the moon

[MICHAEL]
All this bobbing and weaving
All comes from believing

[MICHAEL and CHILDREN]
The magic inside the balloon

[JACK]
The past is the past
It lives on as history
And that's an important thing
The future comes fast
Each second a mystery
For nobody knows what
Tomorrow may bring

This one looks like you

[JANE]
How do you know? Ah!

[ADMIRAL BOOM]
Don't you lose her, son!

[JACK]
I won't, sir!

[JANE]
Up here in the blue
It's a marvelous view

[JANE and JACK]
Side by side is the best way to fly

[JACK]
Once I just looked above
But now I am part of
The lovely London sky

[BALLOON LADY]
Would you like to try one yourself, sir?

[WILKINS]
Uh, I'll give it a go

[BALLOON LADY]
Choose carefully. Well, nowhere to go but up

[ELLEN]
When the clouds make a muss
Well, I won't make a fuss
But I'll polish the stars

[MICHAEL and CHILDREN]
Ellen, better let us

[GOODING and FRYE]
Give a lift to a foe
For you'll reap what you sow

[ALL]
And there's nowhere to go but up

[ADMIRAL BOOM]
I've set sail! Chart a course, Mr. Binnacle!

[MR. BINNACLE]
That I will, sir! Hahaha!

[ALL]
If your day's up the spout
Well there isn't a doubt
There's nowhere to go but up
And if you don't believe
Just hang on to my sleeve
For there's nowhere to go but up

As you fly over town
It gets harder to frown
And we'll all hit the heights
If we never look down

[MICHAEL]
Let the past take a bow
The forever is now

[ALL]
And there's nowhere to go but up, up
There's nowhere to go but up

[BALLOON LADY]
Of course the grownups will all forget by tomorrow

[MARY POPPINS]
They always do

[BALLOON LADY]
Only one balloon left, Mary Poppins. I think it must be yours

[MARY POPPINS]
Yes, I suppose it must. Practically perfect in every way


[Verse 1]
Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!

[Chorus]
Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too
You'll see it's true someone like me
Can learn to be someone like you

[Verse 2]
Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I'll make a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Now, give me the secret, mancub
Come on, clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you

[Chorus]
Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too
You'll see it's true someone like me
Can learn to be someone like you

[Verse 3]
Now you might think it's ridiculous
That me, a gigantipithicus
Would ever dream I'd like to team
With the likes of you, mancub
But together, we'd have powers
All the jungle's treasures, ours
I got desire, you got the fire
But the dream I dream takes two

[Chorus]
So, ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna use that flame just the same
Oh, how magnificus it would be
A gigantipithicus like me
Could learn to do like you humans do
Can learn to be like someone like you
Can learn to be like someone like me


[Verse 1]
What I love most about rivers is:
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing
But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the riverbend
Waiting just around the riverbend

[Chorus]
I look once more
Just around the river bend
Beyond the shore
Where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend
For me
Coming for me

[Verse 2]
I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming
For a handsome sturdy husband
Who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?
Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend

[Chorus]
I look once more
Just around the river bend
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for...
Why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend?
Just around the river bend...

[Verse 3]
Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver
Just around the river bend?


[Verse 1]
Everybody see my sunny
Everybody see my shine
But, they don't know my story
They don't know what's on my mind

I carry on like a princess
But man I've got 'em fooled
Cause underneath my business
I am cold, I'm hard, I'm cruel

[Chorus]
Never gonna put a spell on me
Never ever gonna bring me back
Never gonna make me be
Somethin' I'm not because I'm evil

Tell the people
I'm evil

Open your eyes
I'm all a disguise

[Verse 2]
Everybody in my circle
Think I'm gonna be their friend
But I got bad intentions
And I'm gonna have 'em again

Why should I stop my dissin'
Or soften up my heart
Tell me what good is livin'
If you can't be who you are, yeah

[Chorus]
Never gonna put a spell on me
Never ever gonna bring me back
Never gonna make me be
Somethin' I'm not because I'm evil

Tell the people
I'm evil

Open your eyes
I'm all a disguise

[Bridge]
So good I'm gonna find some trouble, trouble
I'm gonna make some trouble (so good)
I'm gonna find some trouble

[Outro]
Never gonna put a spell on me
Never ever gonna bring me back
Never gonna make me be
Somethin' I'm not...

Because I'm evil

Tell the people, hey
Yeah, yeah
So evil

Open your eyes
I'm all a disguise

So good I'm gonna find some trouble, trouble
I'm gonna make some trouble (hey, yeah)
I'm gonna find some trouble

Oh, no


[Verse 1]
I admit that, in the past, I've a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, "a witch"
But chu'll find it nowadays I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here, lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf of the miserable, lonely, and depressed

[Chorus 1]
Poor unfortunate souls in pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them? Yes, indeed!
Poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them! Yes, I do!

[Verse 2]
Now, it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes, I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole, I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

[Chorus 1]
Poor unfortunate souls in pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them? Yes, indeed!
Poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them! Yes, I do!

[Verse 3]
Th-the men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes, on land it's much preferred  for ladies not to say a word
And, after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?

They're not all that impressed with conversation
"True gentlemen" avoid it when they can
But they dote, and swoon, and fawn
On a lady's who's withdrawn
It's she who hold's her tongue who gets a man!
(C'mon, now!)

[Chorus 2]
Poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead! Make your choice!
I'ma very busy woman, and I haven't got all day!
It won't cost much, just your voice! (uh, yeah-yeah!)
Poor unfortunate soul, it's sad (so sad!), but true
If you wanna cross the bridge, you got to pay the toll
Take a gulp, and take a breath, and go ahead!
And sign the scroll!
(C'mon, you!)
Poor unfortunate souls in pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help (ha, ha, ha, ha) them?  Yes, indeed! (eh- c'mon, girl!)
Poor unfortunate souls in pain, in need
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them! Yes, I do! (Yes, I do!)
Ha-ha

[Outro]
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)


[Verse 1]
It don't matter what you look like
It don't matter what you wear
How many rings you got on your finger
We don't care, no, we don't care!
It don't matter where you come from
Don't even matter what you are
A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat
Had 'em all in here (We had 'em all in here!)

[Pre-Chorus]
And they all knew what they wanted
What they wanted me to do
I told 'em what they needed
Just like I be tellin' you:

[Chorus 1]
You got to dig a little deeper
Find out who you are
You got to dig a little deeper
It really ain't that far
When you find out who you are
You find out what you need
Blue skies and sunshine, guaranteed
You got to dig

[Verse 2]
Listen
Prince Froggy is a rich little boy
You wanna be rich again?
That ain't gonna make you happy now
Did it make you happy then?
Money ain't got no soul
Money ain't got no heart
All you need is some self-control
To make yourself a brand new start

[Chorus 2]
You got to dig a little deeper
Don't have far to go
You got to dig a little deeper
Tell the people Mama told you so
Can't tell you what you'll find
Maybe love will grant you peace of mind
Dig a little deeper and you'll know
You will know

[Verse 3]
Miss Froggy, might I have a word?
You's a hard one, that's what I heard
Your daddy was a loving man
Family through and through
You your daddy's daughter
What he had in him you got in you

[Chorus 3]
You got to dig a little deeper
For you it's gonna be tough
You got to dig a little deeper
You ain't dug near far enough
Dig down deep inside yourself
Find out what you need
Blue skies and sunshine, guaranteed

[Bridge]
Oh uh

[Chorus 3]
You got to dig a little deeper
For you it's gonna be tough
You got to dig a little deeper
You ain't dug near far enough
Dig down deep inside yourself
Find out what you need
Blue skies and sunshine, guaranteed

[Outro]
Guaranteed
Guaranteed
Oh uh
You got to dig a little deeper
You got to dig a little deeper
Oh uh oh


[Chorus: Bert]
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-ee
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-oo
Good luck will rub off when I shakes 'ands with you
Or blow me a kiss, and that's lucky too

[Verse 1: Bert]
Now as the ladder of life 'as been strung
You may think a sweep's on the bottom-most rung
Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke
In this ol' wide world, there's no 'appier bloke

[Chorus: Bert]
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-ee
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-oo
Good luck will rub off when I shakes 'ands with you

[Chorus: Bert, Jane, Michael]
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-ee
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-oo
Good luck will rub off when I shakes 'ands with you

[Verse 2: Bert]
I choose me bristles with pride, yes I do
A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue

[Verse 3: Bert]
Up where the smoke is all billered and curled
'Tween pavement and stars is the chimney sweep world
Where there's 'ardly no day and 'ardly no night
There's things 'alf in shadow and 'alfway in light
On the rooftops of London - coo, what a sight!

[Chorus: Bert & Mary & both]
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-ee
When you're with a sweep, you're in glad company
Nowhere is there a more 'appier crew
Than them wot sings, "Chim chim cher-ee, chim cher-oo"
Chim chiminey, chim chim cher-ee, chim cher-oo


[ELLIE, spoken]
Mom, your life, is a cakewalk!
(sung)
I got this
I got this
I can see what to do for me to be you
I got this

I'll bake stuff
I can fake like I make stuff like you
I'll have a laugh, have my coffee half-caf
And then yell at the staff on your behalf

I got this
Yeah, I got this
Put a stick up my butt, be quick to say, "What? That! Not this!"
I'm perfection, I don't need your direction at all
Call me a slob or a slackerish blob
I can act like a snob and fool that mob
I got this like it's my job

[KATHERINE, spoken]
Good. You can see what it means to have a job. I'll go to school
(sung)
I got this
Yeah, I got this
Do my hair with some care, I'll primp and prepare
I got this
I'm delighted

[ELLIE]
It's not right you're excited for school

[KATHERINE]
Scoff if you may, it's a part I can play
It's only a day, and so I say
I got this
Yes! I got this

I'll be bright and demure
Act right 'til I'm sure they bought this
I'll show you
No, nobody will know it's not you
Leave it to me, 'cause how hard can it be?
When I've got my degree and such esprit
I got this, soon you'll see

I think I'm looking forward to my day, to tell the truth
A day amid the energy and innocence of youth
A thousand fellow students, all excited just like me
A community of learners

(spoken)
Really

(sung)
How hard could it be?
How hard could it be?

[STUDENTS]
I got this (I got this)
I got this (I got this)
I got this (I got... this)
I got this (I...)
I got this

[KATHERINE, spoken]
Good morning. Good morning

[STUDENTS, spoken]
Hey, here comes the List Master!

[STUDENTS, sung]
ADAM!

[ADAM]
Now listen up, you hunters
Here's the rules and here's the deal
The list goes up online at nine
And then The Hunt's for real

Don't schmooze for clues
'Cause I'll refuse
I only do what's right
'Cause I'm List Master Adam
And my word is law tonight

[STUDENTS]
His word is law tonight

Tonight's the night!

We got this
We got this
We got this
We got this

And we're ready to roll, not quite in control
We got this
List Master, please talk faster
At last The Hunt is here!

Give us the news
And the clue to the clues
Cause I'll die if I lose
I swear I will!

[ADAM]
I got this
All must chill

[KATHERINE, spoken]
Hannah, I don't like him, do I?

[HANNAH, spoken]
No. You LOVE him!

[STUDENT, spoken]
Oh God, it's Savannah!

[SAVANNAH]
I got this
I got this
I'm the queen of The Hunt
You're green, you're a grunt
I got this

You'll lose, girl, if you choose to refuse, girl, to see
You shouldn't begin with a war you can't win
'Cause I'm smarter than sin, I'm rich and I'm thin

[SAVANNAH & (STUDENTS)]
Savannah (Look out, it's Savannah)
Vox Humana (She's our Vox Humana)
Is the cock of the walk, I'm talking the top banana
(She's the top banana)
So trust me (Uh-oh)
Watch The Hunt end with just me on top (Top!)
I never fail, no, I always prevail
Ask Harvard and Yale
So weep and wail
I got this
Kiss my tail

[KATHERINE]
I got this

I got this

[TEACHER, spoken]
Ellie Blake, where are you supposed to be right now?

[KATHERINE, spoken]
I don't know


[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
Wanna know a secret?
Promise not to tell?

(sung)
We are standing by a wishing well

Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true


[SEAMUS]
Now where would we all like to go on this fine, fine day?

[MARY POPPINS]
The Royal Doulton Music Hall, please

[JOHN]
Where?

[GEORGIE]
What's that?

[MARY POPPINS]
We're on the brink of an adventure, children-
Don't spoil it with too many questions


In the nursery, you were never by yourself
There was quite another world upon your shelf

[JACK]
Hold on!

[MARY POPPINS]
Where each day crowds make their way upon the sun's descent
To a mythical, mystical, never quite logistical tent

Yes in this dearly dynamical
Simply ceramical Royal Doulton bowl
There's a cuddly and curious
Furry and furious animal watering hole
Where the monkeys and hummingbirds
Know the tunes and the words
Every beast large and small
Loves the very top drawer-able, always encore-able
Royal Doulton Music Hall

[SEAMUS]
Ooh, that one tickled my tail. Nearly there, Mary Poppins!

[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
Yes in this
Marvelous, mystical, rather sophistical Royal Doulton bowl

[JACK]
There's a lot of birds queuing up, a lot of hams chewing up
Scenery they swallow whole
There are lots of cats tuning strings

[MARY POPPINS]
Nightingales in the wings
Waiting for their big drum roll

[JACK]
At the simply sensational-

[MARY POPPINS]
Standing ovation-al-

[MARY POPPINS, JACK, and CHILDREN]
Royal Doulton Music Hall

[SEAMUS]
Here we are!

[ANNABEL]
But where's the music hall?

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh yes- that. Silly me

[instrumental]

[WOLF]
Step right up! Step right up!

[CHILDREN]
Wow!

[ANNABEL]
Goodness! How on Earth did she do that?

[JACK]
One thing you should know about Mary Poppins -- she never explains anything. Come on!

[WOLF]
Hurry, hurry. Get tickets while you can. For the one night only, one and only -- Mary Poppins! What an honor it is to have you join us this evening

[MARY POPPINS]
Thank you

[WOLF]
And who is this I see? Why, it's John, Annabel and Georgie Banks!

[JOHN]
You know us?

[WOLF]
Of course! Everyone knows the Banks children. Hurry along now. Get yourself some peanuts and candyfloss and go right on in
May we Mary Poppins?

[MARY POPPINS]
Yes- just keep away from the edge of the bowl

[FLAMINGO DANCERS]
At the highly acclaimable, nearly untamable
Lavishly praisable, always roof-raise-able
Royal Doulton Music Hall


[DREAM ELEPHANTS]
Look out! Look out!
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come!
Hippity-hoppity
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

Look out! Look out!
They're walking around the bed, on their head
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade

(What'll I do? What'll I do?
What an unusual view!)
(I could stand the sight of worms
And look at microscopic germs
But technicolor pachyderms
Is really too much for me)

(I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seeing things you know that ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright!
What a sight!)

Chase 'em away!
Chase 'em away!
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade!

Pink elephants!
Pink elephants!


[Verse]
I met this girl who rocked my world
Like it's never been rocked
And now I'm living just for her
And I won't ever stop
I never thought that it could happen to a guy like me
But now look at what you've done
You got me, down on my knee


[Part 1: In a World of My Own]

[Alice]
If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't. And contrary wise, everything what it is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would

[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
Cats and rabbits would reside in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
In a world of my own
All the flowers would have very extra special powers
They would sit and talk to me for hours
When I'm lonely in a world of my own
There'd be no birds
Lots of nice and friendly howdy-do birds
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds

[Chorus]
Within that world of my own
In a world of my own
In a world of my own, my own
In a world of my own, in a world of my own
In a world of my own

[Verse 2]
I could listen to a babbling brook and hear a song that I could understand
I keep wishing it could be that way
I keep wishing it could be that way
I keep wishing it could be that way
Because my world would be a wonderland

[Part 2: Very Good Advice]

[Alice]
Well, when one's lost I... I suppose it's good avice to stay where you are until someone finds you. But who'd ever think to look for me here. Good advice

[Verse: Jhené Aiko]
I give myself very good advice
But I very seldom follow it
That explains the trouble I'm always in
"Be patient" is very good advice
But the waiting makes me curious
And I love the change
Should something strange begin

Well, I went along my merry way
And I never stopped to reason
I should've known there'd be a price to pay some day
I do give myself very good advice
But I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn to do the things I should?

I do give myself very good advice
But I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn to do the things I should?
In a world of my own
In a world of my own


[SALLY]
I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice
My feelings for him?

And will he see?
How much he means to me
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
All though I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic loud
Try as I may
It doesn't last

And will we ever
End up together?
No I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one


[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I think he likes me

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Likes you?
Please, Rapunzel, that's demented
This is why you never should have left
Dear, this whole romance that you've invented
Just proves you're too naive to be here
Why would he like you? Come on now, really?
Look at you, you think that he's impressed?
Don't be a dummy
Come with mummy
Mother-

[RAPUNZEL]
No!

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
No?
Oh, I see how it is

(sung)

Rapunzel knows best
Rapunzel's so mature now
Such a clever grown-up miss
Rapunzel knows best
Fine, if you're so sure now
Go ahead, then give him this

This is why he's here!
Don't let him deceive you!
Give it to him, watch, you'll see!

Trust me, my dear
That's how fast he'll leave you
I won't say I told you so - no
Rapunzel knows best!
So if he's such a dreamboat
Go and put him to the test

If he's lying
Don't come crying
Mother knows best...


[Verse 1]
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that's held in your arms
And what do you think you'd ever say?
I won't listen anyway
You don't know me
And I'll never be what you want me to be

[Verse 2]
And what do you think you'd understand?
I'm a boy—no, I'm a man
You can't take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what's never shown?
Yeah, you stand here on your own
They don't know me 'cause I'm not here

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change?
They're the ones that stay the same
They don't know me 'cause I'm not here

[Verse 3]
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted, I could be
Now you know me, and I'm not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can't break me, as long as I know who I am

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on, and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change?
They're the ones that stay the same
They can't see me but I'm still here

[Bridge]
They can't tell me who to be
'Cause I'm not what they see
Yeah, the world is still sleepin'
While I keep on dreamin' for me
And their words are just whispers
And lies that I'll never believe

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on, and feel I belong
And how can you say I'll never change?
They're the ones that stay the same
I'm the one now 'cause I'm still here

[Outro]
I'm the one, 'cause I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here


Who's strong and brave here to save the American Way?
Who's vows to fight like a man for what's right, night and day?
Who will campaign door to door for America?
Carry the flag shore to shore for America?
From Hoboken to Spokane?

The Star Spangled Man with a plan!

We can't ignore there's a threat and a war we must win!
Who'll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goose from Berlin?
Who will indeed lead the call for America?
Who'll rise or fall, give his all, for America?
Who's here to prove that we can?

The Star Spangled Man with a plan!

Stalwart and steady and true!
(See how this guy can shoot! We tell you, there's no substitute!)
Forceful and ready to defend the red, white, and blue!
(The red, white and blue!)

Who'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox?
(Sure as an Eagle will soar!)
Who's makin' Adolph afraid to step out of his box?
(He's knows what we're fighting for!)

Who'll whip the giant attacking America?
We know it's no one but Captain America!
Who'll finish what they began?
Who'll kick the Krauts to Japan?

The Star Spangled Man with a Plan!
(Who's strong and brave here to save the American way?)
