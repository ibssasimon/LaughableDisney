[Verse 1]
I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

[Refrain 1]
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know where I cannot go
Where I long to be

[Chorus 1]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Verse 2]
I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

[Refrain 2]
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus 2]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

[Chorus 3]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go


[Verse 1]
Okay, okay, I see what's happening here
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui, breathe it in
I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod

[Chorus]
What can I say except "you're welcome"?
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy!

[Verse 2]
Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high? This guy
When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?
You're looking at him, yo!
Oh, also I lassoed the sun, you're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also, I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees

[Chorus]
So, what can I say except "you're welcome"?
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome, you're welcome

[Verse 3]
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly, I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been, I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tapping
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey

[Chorus]
Well anyway, let me say "you're welcome"
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say "you're welcome"
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome
'Cause Maui can do everything but float
You're welcome, you're welcome

[Outro]
And thank you!


[Verse 1]
I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

[Pre-Chorus]
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be

[Chorus]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Post-Chorus]
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I know everybody on this island seems so happy
On this island, everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go


[Intro: Aladdin and Jasmine]
How are you doing that?
It's a magic carpet
I-it's lovely...
You don't...you don't wanna go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world
Is it safe?
Sure, do you trust me?
What?
Do you trust me?
Yes...

[Verse 1: Aladdin]
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Refrain 1: Aladdin]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "no"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Refrain 2: Jasmine (and Aladdin)]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)

[Verse 2: Jasmine]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Refrain 3: Jasmine (and Aladdin)]
A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath; it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Refrain 4: Aladdin (and Jasmine)]
A whole new world
(Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Refrain 5: Aladdin (and Jasmine)]
A whole new world
(A whole new world)
That's where we'll be
(That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase
(A wondrous place)
For you and me


[Intro]
Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba
Sithi uhm ingonyama

Nants ingonyama bagithi baba
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama
Ingonyama

Siyo Nqoba
Ingonyama
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There is more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The Circle of Life

It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The Circle of Life


[Verse 1]
Here comes a wave meant to wash me away
A tide that is taking me under
Swallowing sand, left with nothing to say
My voice drowned out in the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't cry
And I won't start to crumble
Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down

[Chorus]
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

[Verse 2]
Written in stone
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
"Stay in your place"
"Better seen and not heard"
But now that story is ending

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I
I cannot start to crumble
So come on and try
Try to shut me and cut me down

[Chorus]
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless
Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

[Bridge]
Try to lock me in this cage
I won't just lay me down and die
I will take these broken wings
And watch me burn across the sky
Hear the echo saying:

[Chorus]
I won't be silenced
Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

[Outro]
All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless


[Intro: Opetaia Foa'i]
Tatou o tagata folau e vala’auina

[Hook 1: Chorus, Opetaia Foa'i]
Aue, aue
Nuku i mua

Aue, aue

[Verse 1: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
We read the wind and the sky when the sun is high
We sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze
At night, we name every star
We know where we are
We know who we are, who we are

[Hook 2: Chorus, Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Aue, aue
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

[Hook 3: Chorus, Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Aue, aue
We are explorers reading every sign
We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain
Aue, aue
Te fenua te mālie
Nae ko hakilia
We know the way


[TAMATOA]
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful, baby
Did your granny say, "Listen to your heart"?
"Be who you are on the inside"?
I need three words to tear her argument apart
Your granny lied

I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't you know?
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh, and here they come, come, come
To the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm, fish dinners

I just love free food
And you look like seafood

Well, well, well
Little Maui's having trouble with his look
You little semi-demi-mini-god
Ouch! What a terrible performance
Get the hook! (Get it?)
You don't swing it like you used to, man

Yet I have to give you credit for my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide, I can't

I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You could try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod
To beat a decapod (Look it up)
You will die, die, die
Now it's time for me to take apart
Your aching heart

Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans
Who made you feel wanted
You try to be tough
But your armour's just not hard enough

Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney
Ever seen someone so

Shiny?
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea
Just for me

You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny


[Verse 1]
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

[Verse 2]
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got troubles, and I've got 'em, too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and we see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

[Bridge]
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too, maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you, boy

[Verse 3]
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see, it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me


[Letra de "Un Poco Loco" ft. Gael García Bernal]

[Intro: Luis Angel Gómez Jaramillo]
Uhh...
¡Ahh-ayy!

[Verso 1: Luis Angel Gómez Jaramillo]
Que el cielo no es azul
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Que es rojo dices tú
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Ves todo al revés
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Creo que piensas con los pies
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor

[Coro: Luis Angel Gómez Jaramillo]
Tú me traes un poco loco, un poquititito loco
Estoy adivinando qué quieres y pa' cuándo
Y así estoy celebrando
Que me he vuelto un poco loco

[Verso 2: Gael García Bernal, Luis Ángel Gómez Jaramillo, Juntos]
Chiflado tú me vuelves, eso está un poco loco
Tu mente que despega, tú siempre con ideas
Con mi cabeza juegas, todo es un poco loco

[Estribillo: Gael García Berna]
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas (¡vámonos, Miguelito!)
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas
Todo es un poco loco, con mi cabeza juegas

[Outro: Gael García Bernal & Luis Ángel Gómez Jaramillo]
¡Un poquititititititititi-titititito loco!
¡Ay, ay, ah!


[Intro: Choir]
Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti
Beatae Mariae semper Virgini
Beato Michaeli archangelo
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis

[Verse 1]
Beata Maria
You know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud

(Et tibit Pater)

Beata Maria
You know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd

(Quia peccavi nimis)

Then tell me, Maria
Why I see her dancing there
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul

(Cogitatione)

I feel her, I see her
The sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control

(Verbo et opere)

[Chorus]
Like fire
Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning
Desire
Is turning me to sin

[Verse 2]
It's not my fault
(Mea culpa)
I'm not to blame
It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
(Mea maxima culpa)
It's not my fault
(Mea culpa)
If in God's plan
(Mea culpa)
He made the devil so much
Stronger than a man
(Mea maxima culpa)

Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone

[Chorus]
Hellfire
Dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or
Your pyre
Be mine or you will burn

[Outro]
God have mercy on her
(Kyrie Eleison)
God have mercy on me
(Kyrie Eleison)
But she will be mine
Or she will burn!


[Intro]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

[Verse 1]
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn’t keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
Well, now they know

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Verse 2]
It’s funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can’t get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know left a life behind
But I’m too relieved to grieve

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Bridge]
Standing frozen in the life I’ve chosen
You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Buried in the snow

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Outro]
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Na na
(Na na, na na) Let it go
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na) Let it go
(Na na) Ooh
(Na na na na na) Let it go


[Intro]
I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?

[Verse 1]
I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen

[Verse 2]
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean

[Verse 3]
Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (Endless)

[Bridge]
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn

[Chorus]
If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
'Cause the devil's on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

[Outro]
I want what I deserve


[Verse 1]
Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet, before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you

[Verse 2]
Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

[Bridge]
I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say good-bye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[Verse 3]
Time is racing toward us, till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order, and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon


[Verse 1: Anna]
The window is open, so's that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they're opening up the gates

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anna]
There'll be actual, real-life people
It'll be totally strange
Wow, am I so ready for this change

[Chorus 1: Anna]
'Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in the zone
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

[Interlude: Anna]
I can't wait to meet everyone!
Oh, what if I meet the one?

[Verse 2: Anna]
Tonight, imagine me, gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anna]
But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've led so far

[Chorus 2: Anna]
For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

[Bridge: Elsa]
Don't let them in
Don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel
Put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

[Pre-Chorus 3: Elsa and Anna]
But it's only for today (It's only for today)
It's agony to wait (It's agony to wait)
Tell the guards to open up the gates (The gates)

[Chorus 3: Anna and Elsa]
For the first time in forever (Don't let them in, don't let them see)
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of (Be the good girl you always have to be)
A chance to change my lonely world (Conceal)
A chance to find true love (Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know)

[Coda: Anna]
I know it all ends tomorrow
So it has to be today
'Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way!


[ARIEL, spoken]
Maybe he's right. Maybe there is something the matter with me
I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad...

(sung)
Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you think
"Sure, she's got everything"
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal, I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em? Oh - feet!

Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a - what's that word again? Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word? Burn?

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea, wish I could be part of that world


[TIMON & (PUMBAA)]
I can see what's happening (What?)
And they don't have a clue (Who?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line - our trio's down to two. (Oh.)

(In a sarcastic mock-French accent)
Ze sweet caress of twilight
(Back to normal, but still sarcastic)
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

[SIMBA]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me

[NALA]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

[TIMON]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed

[PUMBAA]
His carefree days with us are history

[TIMON & PUMBAA]
In short: Our pal is doomed


[RAPUNZEL]
All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be

And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you

[FLYNN]
All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go

[FLYNN & RAPUNZEL]
And at last I see the light

[FLYNN]
And it's like the fog has lifted

[FLYNN & RAPUNZEL]
And at last I see the light

[RAPUNZEL]
And it's like the sky is new

[FLYNN & RAPUNZEL]
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you

Now that I see you


[Intro: Meg Donnelly]
Oh
La la la la la
Oh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
I know it might be crazy
But did you hear the story?
I think I heard it vaguely
A girl and a zombie
Oh, tell me more, boy
Yeah
Sounds like a fantasy
Oh, what could go so wrong
With a girl and a zombie
You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darker side
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me
Right from the start you caught my eye
And something inside me came to life
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Yeah, yeah
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Girl, you look delicious
Oh, I mean gorgeous
Well, now you're getting fearless
No, I'm just rooting for us
If different was a super power
We'd be so flawless
Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours
I'm rooting for us
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark
Imagine it now they start a spark
You got my attention
What happens next, then?
Movies and long walks in the park
Hanging out anywhere we want
I like the way you're thinking
I can almost see it

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday

[Bridge: Meg Donnelly]
So let them talk if they wanna
Let them talk if they're gonna
We're gonna do what we wanna
Let them talk, let them talk
If they wanna, they wanna

[bell rings]

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday

Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!

[PUMBAA]
Hakuna matata! Ain't no passing craze!

[TIMON]
It means no worries, for the rest of your days...

[TIMON & PUMBAA]
It's our problem-free philosophy...

[TIMON]
Hakuna matata!

Why, when he was a young warthog...

[PUMBAA]
When I was a young warthog...

[TIMON]
Very nice

[PUMBAA]
Thanks

[TIMON]
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after every meal

[PUMBAA]
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And, oh, the shame!

[TIMON]
He was ashamed

[PUMBAA]
Thought of changin' my name!

[TIMON]
Oh, what's in a name?

[PUMBAA]
And I got downhearted

[TIMON]
How did ya feel?

[PUMBAA]
Everytime that I...

[TIMON]
Hey! Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!

[PUMBAA]
Oh. Sorry...

[TIMON & PUMBAA]
Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze

[SIMBA]
It means no worries for the rest of your days

[TIMON]
Yeah, sing it, kid!

[TIMON & SIMBA]
It's our problem-free

[PUMBAA]
Philosophy

[TIMON & PUMBAA & SIMBA]
Hakuna Matata!

[TIMON & PUMBAA & SIMBA]
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna...

[SIMBA]
It means no worries for the rest of your days

[TIMON & PUMBAA & SIMBA]
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!

(SIMBA scat sings to fade)


(Make way for Prince Ali!)
(Say hey! It's Prince Ali!)

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a bright new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
Oh! You're gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect, down on one knee!
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as 10 regular men, definitely!
(He faced the galloping hordes)
(A hundred bad guys with swords)
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

(He's got 75 golden camels)
Don't they look lovely, June?
(Purple peacocks, he's got 53)
Fabulous Harry, I love the feathers!
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
(Has he got a zoo?)
(I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie)

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak, weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!

He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him!)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
(With 60 elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for Prince Ali!)


[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

[Pre-Chorus]
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there’s nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out


[Hook 1]
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life

[Verse 1]
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few

[Interlude 1]
(You eat ants!?)
Haha, you better believe it
You're going to love the way they tickle
(Mowgli, watch out!)

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

[Hook 2]
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life

[Verse 2]
Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw

[Interlude 2]
Have I given you a clue?
(Golly, thanks Baloo!)
(Pawpaw, hah! Of all the silly gibberish)
C'mon Baggy, get with the beat!

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

[Verse 3]
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard

[Verse 4]
And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!


[Intro]
Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(Uishi kwa uishi kwa)
Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(Uishi kwa, uishi kwa)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, and the wind is talkin'
Yeah, yeah, for the very first time
With a melody that pulls you towards it
Paintin' pictures of paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Watch the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, woah

[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, and the water's crashin'
Trying to keep your head up high
While you're trembling, that's when the magic happens
And the stars gather by, by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Let the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, yeah

[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-ight

[Bridge]
So go into that far off land
And be one with the Great I Am, I Am
A boy becomes a man, woah

[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah
Spirit, yeah, watch the heavens open, open
Yeah
Spirit, spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-i-ight

[Outro]
So go into a far off land
And be one with the Great I Am


You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know...

You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

How high will the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon

For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind


[Verse 1]
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Outro]
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best


[GRAMMA TALA]
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are

The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on Earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
"Moana, you've come so far"
Moana listen, do you know who you are?

[MOANA, spoken]
Who am I?

(sung)
I am a girl who loves my island
And the girl who loves the sea, it calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me

I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me

And the call isn't out there at all
It's inside me
It's like the tide
Always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart
You'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way

I am Moana!


[CHIEF TUI]
Moana, make way, make way
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is all you need
The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song

[VILLAGERS]
Who needs a new song?
This old one's all we need

[CHIEF TUI]
This tradition is our mission
And Moana there's
So much to do
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need
We share everything we make
We joke and we
Weave our baskets
The fishermen come back
From the sea

[VILLAGERS]
Make way!
That's all you need
We make!

A ha!

[BABY MOANA]
I wanna see...

[CHIEF TUI]
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief and
There you are

[VILLAGERS]
There you are


[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is where you are

[CHIEF TUI]
Consider the coconut

Consider its tree
We use each part
Of the coconut
That's all we need

[SINA]
We make our nets
From the fibers

The water is
Sweet inside

We use the leaves
To build fires

We cook up
The meat inside


[CHIEF TUI]
Consider the coconuts

The trunks and the leaves
[VILLAGERS]

The what?

We use each part
Of the coconut
That's all we need



We make our nets
From the fibers

The water is
Sweet inside

We use the leaves
To build fires

We cook up
The meat inside



Consider the coconuts

Ha!

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
The island gives us what we need

[YOUNG MOANA]
And no one leaves...

[CHIEF TUI]
That's right we stay
We're safe and
We're well provided
And when we look
To the future
There you are
You'll be okay
In time you'll learn
Just as I did

[VILLAGERS]
 
 
 
 
 
There you are

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
You must find happiness
Right where you are

[GRAMMA TALA]
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous, ha!
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like
Well there you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside
Is who you are

[MEN]
We make our nets
From the fibers
The water's sweet inside
We use the leaves
To build fires
To cook up
The meat inside

[CHIEF TUI]
The village believes in us

[CHIEF TUI & SINA]
The village believes
The island gives us
What we need

[CHIEF TUI]
And no one leaves

[MOANA]
So here I'll stay
My home, my
People beside me
And when I
Think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way
I'll have my people
To guide me
We'll build our
Future together

Cause every path
Leads you back to

You can find happiness right
[SINA & WOMEN]

We weave our nets
From the fibers
A real tasty treat inside
We sing the songs
In our choirs
We have mouths
To feed inside

[WOMEN]
That's right!
The island gives us
What we need

[VILLAGE]
There we are

Where we are
Where you are
Where you are
Where you are


[Toddler Anna +  Young Elsa]
Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play!
I never see you anymore, come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies, and now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Go away, Anna!)
Okay, bye

[Young Anna]
Do you wanna build a snowman
Or ride our bikes around the halls?
I think some company is overdue, I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls
Hang in there, Joan
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Adult Anna]
Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say "have courage" and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in
We only have each other, it's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a snowman?


[Verse 1: Jordan Fisher]
I see what's happening here
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
It's nice to see that humans never change

[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Fisher]
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes it's really me, breathe it in
I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod

[Chorus: Jordan Fisher & Lin-Manuel Miranda]
So what can I say except "You're welcome"
For the tide, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
So what can I say except "You're welcome"
For the tide, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcomeI'm just an ordinary demi-guy

[Rap: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Honestly, I can go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was me, I was messing around
I killed a snake, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now we've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tikkity tappin'
Singing and scratchin'
Flipping and snappin'
People are clappin', hearing me rap and
Bring the chorus back in

[Chorus: Jordan Fisher]
Well anyway, let me say you're welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome
'Cause Maui's the ultimate god woah

[Outro: Jordan Fisher]
You're welcome, you're welcome


[Intro: All]
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack hit 'em 'til the armor cracks

[Verse 1: China Anne McClain, Dove Cameron, Sofia Carson]
This could get a little sticky
How to win this battle could be tricky but I know the best way
Fall back let me lead, you hold the line
And we'll bring them to their knees
Swords in the air if you're with me
They got us outnumbered one to fifty
But victory is ours 'cause I got a strategy, you take the left
And the rest of you can follow me (Un-uh)
This is my crew
This is my squad
This is my turf
Oh my gosh, look guys
We've got bigger fish to fry
Put your differences aside
'Cause right now we're on the same side

[Chorus: Sofia Carson, Girls, All]
Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast they're too heavy to react

[Verse 2: Dove Cameron & China Anne McClain]
This situation's getting kinda heavy
Hold your weapons tight keep 'em steady
'Cause if we stick together we can make it out alive
I'll cause a distraction, you attack them from the side
All my soldiers stand at the ready
We can cut 'em up like a confetti
We'll hit 'em from the front, you counter from behind
Don't forget the fate of Auradon's on the line

[Pre-Chorus: All, Dove Cameron]
This is all out war, they got us outnumbered
The way the swords clash is the sound of the thunder
And we are not going under, we will never run for cover
We battle for the victory and ride for each other

[Chorus: Sofia Carson, Girls, All]
Until the night falls everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
We can counter their attack hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast they're too heavy to react

[Verse 3: Dove Cameron]
Suit of armor strong and true
Make this metal bust a move!

[Outro: Sofia Carson, Girls, All]
Until the night falls, you can trust
I'm gonna help you win this battle because
I got your back, got your back
Got your back, got your back
All for one and that's a fact, knights fall pitch black


[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oooh

[Verse 1]
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next

[Pre-Chorus]
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh

[Verse 2]
Look at how far you've come, you filled your heart with love
Baby you've done enough, take a deep breath
Don't beat yourself up, don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Bridge]
I'll keep on making those new mistakes
I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything
Oh oh oh oh oooh
Try everything


[Verse 1]
I have often dreamed of a far-off place
Where a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be

[Chorus]
I will find my way, I can go the distance
I'll be there someday, if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to feel like I belong

[Intrumental interlude]

[Chorus]
I am on my way, I can go the distance
I don't care how far, somehow I'll be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to find where I belong


[Verse 1: ZAYN]
I can show you the world: shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride

[Chorus: ZAYN & Zhavia Ward]
A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "no," or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world, a dazzling place I never knew
But when I’m way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I’m in a whole new world with you

[Verse 2: Zhavia Ward]
Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath; it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world, with new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "no," or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world (Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment, red-letter)
I’ll chase them anywhere, there’s time to spare
Anywhere, ooh, ooh (There's time to spare)
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Outro: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
That’s where we'll be (That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (A wondrous place)
For you and me


[Intro: Anna and Hans]
Okay, can I just - say something crazy?
I love crazy!

[Verse 1:Anna and Hans]
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you
I was thinking the same thing!
'Cause, like, I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue...

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anna, Hans, Both]
But with you (But with you)
I found my place (I see your face)
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

[Chorus 1: Anna, Hans, Both]
Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Love is an open door
With you, with you
With you, with you
Love is an open door

[Verse 2: Anna, Hans, Both]
I mean it's crazy (What?)
We finish each others'—
Sandwiches!
That's what I was gonna say!
I never met someone who thinks so much like me
Jinx. Jinx again!
Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation
You and I were just meant to be!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anna, Hans, Both]
Say goodbye (Say goodbye) to the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore

[Chorus 2: Anna, Hans, Both]
Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Life can be so much more
With you, with you
With you, with you
Love is an open door (Door)

[Outro: Anna and Hans]
Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?
Can I say something even crazier?
Yes!


[Intro]
Ariel, listen to me
The human world, it's a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they've got up there

[Verse 1]
The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

[Hook 1]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

[Verse 2]
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
(Guess who's gon' be on the plate)

[Hook 2]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us in fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles

[Hook 3]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here naturally
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea

[Verse 2]
The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat, they know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow

[Hook 3]
Under the sea
Under the sea
When the sardine begin the beguine
It's music to me
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea


[MOANA]
There's a line where the sky meets the sea and it calls me
But no one knows, how far it goes
All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me
I'm on my own, to worlds unknown

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Is a choice I make, now I can't turn back
From the great unknown where I go alone
Where I long to be

See her light up the night in the sea, she calls me
And yes I know that I can go
There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me
Soon I'll know how far I'll go


[SIMBA]
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

[ZAZU]
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair

[SIMBA]
I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my roar!

[ZAZU]
Thus far, a rather... uninspiring thing

[SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

[ZAZU]
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...

[SIMBA]
No one saying do this

[ZAZU]
Now when I said that, I -

[NALA]
No one saying be there

[ZAZU]
What I meant was...

[SIMBA]
No one saying stop that

[ZAZU]
Look, what you don't realize...

[SIMBA & NALA]
No one saying see here

[ZAZU]
Now see here!

[SIMBA]
Free to run around all day

[ZAZU]
Well, that's definitely out

[SIMBA]
Free to do it all my way!

[ZAZU]
I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart

[SIMBA]
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start

[ZAZU]
If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa - I wouldn't hang about... aagh!
This child is getting wildly out of wing

[SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm standing in the spotlight!

[ZAZU]
Not yet!

[ANIMALS]
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

[ANIMALS & SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait... to be king!


[Intro: Genie (Will Smith)]
Here I go!
Unh, ooh, woo!
Back up! Uh-oh! Watch out! Unh!
You done wound me up!
'Boutta show you what I'm workin' with, unh!

[Verse 1: Genie (Will Smith)]
Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
All you gotta do is rub that lamp
And then I'll say

[Verse 2: Genie (Will Smith)]
Mister– Man, what's your name? Whatever–
What will your pleasure be?

You ain't never had a friend like me

[Refrain: Genie (Will Smith), spoken]
Oh! Unh!
It's the big part, watch out!
It's the big part, oh!

[Bridge: Genie (Will Smith)]
Can your friends do this?

Can your friends pull this
Outta they little hat?
Can your friends go–
I'm the genie of the lamp
I can sing, rap, dance, if you give me a chance, oh!

[Verse 4: Genie (Will Smith)]
Don't sit there buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so

You ain't never had a friend like me!


[HOOK HAND THUG]
I'm malicious, mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
But despite my evil look
And my temper, and my hook
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
Can'tcha see me on the stage performin' Mozart?
Ticklin' the ivories 'til they gleam?
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley
Thank you!
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

[THUGS]
He's got a dream!
He's got a dream!

[HOOK HAND THUG]
See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem!
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers
Like everybody else
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
La la la la la la la la la la la la!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes
And let's not even mention my complexion
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter, and my nose
I really want to make a love connection
Can't you see me with a special little lady
Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover, not a fighter
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
He's got a dream!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
He's got a dream!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
And I know one day romance will reign supreme!
Though my face leaves people screaming
There's a child behind it, dreaming
Like everybody else
I've got a dream

[THUGS]
Tor would like to quit and be a florist
Gunther does interior design
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime
Bruiser knits
Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

[HOOK HAND THUG]
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns!

[FLYNN]
I have dreams, like you - no, really!
Just much less touchy-feely
They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone
Surrounded by enormous piles of money

[RAPUNZEL]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
She's got a dream!

[RAPUNZEL]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
She's got a dream!

[RAPUNZEL]
I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam!

[THUGS]
Yeah!

[RAPUNZEL]
And with every passing hour
I'm so glad I left my tower
Like all you lovely folks
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
She's got a dream!
He's got a dream!
They've got a dream!
We've got a dream!
So our diff'rences ain't
Really that extreme!
We're one big team!
Call us brutal
Sick

[HOOK HAND THUG]
Sadistic

[BIG NOSE THUG]
And grotesquely optimistic

[THUGS]
'Cause way down deep inside
We've got a dream!

[HOOK HAND THUG]
I've got a dream!

[BIG NOSE THUG]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!

[RAPUNZEL]
I've got a dream!

[THUGS]
Whoo whoo whoo whoo!

[ALL]
Yes, way down deep inside
I've got a dream!
Yeah!


[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim]
I'm fired up
Tryouts today
I'm going to blow ‘em away yeah
Dad says I can't go wrong, no
As long as I keep this on, oh
Seabrook's been the best like forever
Moms counting on me no pressure
Cheer's in my family genes
Come on let's do this thing

Now what up everybody
Let me set the scene
Fresh new start for your boy young z
You saw pops for a dad he's cool
He's just a little stressed about my first day of school
They say "be careful those humans can be mean"
But I'm still going out for the football teamThis might look rough but it's home sweet home
Just a little bit of dust and a little bit of mold
But it ain't so bad on this side of tracks
We make it work with a little bit of swag

On this side we can all keep winning
If we just try to fit in

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & All]
Watch it come together
Be the best one ever
Because it's my time
This is going to be my year

Been waiting for this moment
Yeah I'm gonna own it
You can watch me shine
This is gonna be my year
My year my year
My my my year
My year
My year
My year
My year

[Verse 2: Kylee Russell & Milo Manheim & James Godfrey]
Now let me introduce you to my friend Eliza
We'll never be accepted zombies need to rise up
Fight the good fight stand for whats right
We get the worst jobs and a curfew at night
They make us wear uniforms that all look the same
Why's it just us being treated this way
I say we stick it to their institution
You want justice we need a revolution

Yeah you got a point but today's an improvement
'Cause baby steps is still movement
Hey Bonzo come and spit a verse
A zig zagg gwag gwad ziggy got gon
Ziggity got goat zag ziggy got zong
He just dropped that in zombie

Yeah all he said is he's hungry

[Verse 3: Trevor Tordjman & Meg Donnelly]
My cuz Bucky's the man
Look at how perfect he lands
Our very own cheer rock star

No more autographs please stay where you are
Another year and I only get better
Another cheer another varsity letter
This year we just can't lose
Well I'm gonna win you'all can come too

[Chorus: All]
My year
My year
My year
My year
Watch it come together
Be the best one ever
Because it's my time
This is gonna be my year
Been waiting for this moment
Yeah I'm gonna own it
You can watch me shine
This is gonna be my year
My year my year
My year my year
My my my year
My year my year

This is gonna be my year


[SCAR, spoken]
I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain

(sung)
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But–thick as you are–pay attention!
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares!

So prepare for the chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

[SHENZI]
And where do we feature?

[SCAR]
Just listen to teacher

I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Yeah, be prepared! Haha! We'll be prepared! For what?

[SCAR, spoken]
For the death of the king!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Why? Is he sick?

[SCAR, spoken]
No, fool, we're going to kill him. And Simba too!

[SHENZI, spoken]
Great idea! Who needs a king?

[SHENZI & BANZAI & ED, spoken]
No king, no king, la la la la la la!

[SCAR, spoken]
Idiots! There will be a king!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Hey, but you said, uh...

[SCAR, spoken]
I will be king! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!

[HYENAS, spoken]
Yeah! Alright! Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

(sung)
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

[SCAR]
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

[SCAR & HYENAS]
So prepare for the coup of the century (Oooh!)
Be prepared for the murkiest scam (Oooh... La! La! La!)
Meticulous planning (We'll have food!)
Tenacity spanning (Lots of food)
Decades of denial (We repeat)
Is simply why I'll (Endless meat)
Be king undisputed (Aaah...)
Respected, saluted (...aaah...)
And seen for the wonder I am (...aaah!)
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared (Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!


[Verse 1: Megara]
If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that

[Bridge 1: Muses]
Who d'you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

[Chorus 1: Megara + Muses]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh)
(Why deny it? Uh-oh)
It's too cliché
I won't say I'm in love

[Verse 2: Megara]
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"

[Bridge 2: Muses]
(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?

[Chorus 2: Megara + Muses]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in)
(Check the grin; you're in love)
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
(You're doin' flips)
(Read our lips: "You're in love")

You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud!)
(It's okay, you're in love)

Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in love
(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)
(Sha-la-la-la la la, ahh)


[Verse 1: Hades, Mal]
Listen, little girl
You're talking to a god
And I don’t wanna hear the drama
Kindness ain't my brand
Oh, I guess that's why you ran
Try being married to your mama!
You stink at being a dad
Poor Mali, are you sad?
Not as sad as you without your powers
I didn’t come to fight
For once, do something right
I steal souls, were you expecting flowers?

[Pre-Chorus: Hades, Mal]
I only need you 'cause I came here for something
I've given you everything, by giving you (me) nothing

[Chorus: Hades, Mal]
I did what I had to do (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, you only did what's best for you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do, yeah

[Verse 2: Hades, Mal]
You were never there
Guess you don't have a phone
You never called to say "I miss you"
Ha ha ha, are you kidding? Is this a joke?
You need to let it go
You're stronger with those daddy issues
Oh! Thank you!
Show me some respect
It ain't easy to neglect
My attention would've made you softer
Ooh-hoo! Should I be proud?
Don’t turn this thing around
I guess you are your father’s daughter, ha, ha, ha

[Pre-Chorus: Hades, Mal]
Don't think I need you, I just came here for something
I’ve given you everything, by giving you (me) nothing

[Chorus: Hades, Mal]
I did what I had to do (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I made it on my own, no thanks to you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do

[Bridge: Hades, Mal, both]
How 'bout I go with you and we'll spend some time?
How 'bout you stay here ’cause you're out of your mind!
Let's make new memories, you can show me the town
No, you can keep your memories now
Get over it
I am over it!
I'm over you being over it!
Let's dance

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Both]
I did what I had to do (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, you only did what's best for you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove, you do-
When push comes to shove, you do-
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do


[Verse 1]
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say -

[Chorus]
"Mr. Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down"
You ain't never had a friend like me, ha ha ha
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come on, whisper what it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me

[Verse 2]
Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
You're the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you wish, it's yours! True dish
How about a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Wah-ah-ah, mo-my
Wah-ah-ah, no-no
Wah-ah-ah, my my my

[Bridge]
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Hey, looky here, ha ha
Can your friends go "Abracadabra," let 'er rip
And then make the sucker disappear

[Verse 3]
So don't you sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so

[Chorus]
Mister Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend, you ain't
Never had a friend, never had a friend

[Outro]
You ain't
Never... had a...
Friend... like
Me
Ya-ha-ha
Wah-ha-ha
You ain't never had a friend like me!


[Verse 1]
Don't freak out, it's okay
'Cause  true love can save the day
And  I think we feel the same
But I don't know
When we met, it was sweet
He  was oh so into me
Seems  like things are meant to be
But I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Does  he love me? Or does he love me not?
Do I love him? And is it strong enough?

[Chorus]
One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One  kiss, one kiss
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)

[Verse 2]
Keep it cool, keep it calm
Think he's loved me all along
But maybe I got it wrong
So I don't know (hey)
He's so good, got my back
But maybe I'm just too bad
Could we be a perfect match?
Now, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Does he love me? Or does he love me not?
Do I love him? And is it strong enough?

[Chorus]
One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)
Yeah, here I go

[Bridge]
I feel my heartbeat beating saying "It's gonna work"
But if I'm dream-dream-dreaming, this is gonna hurt
Either I will or I won't
What if I do and he don't?
Is he my Romeo?
Oh, there's only one, one way to really know

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)

[Outro]
Here I go
Here I go
Here I go


[Verse 1: Trevor Tordjman]
Listen up, it's not so tough
I'll tell you how it's done
There's really nothing better
Than to hear you're number one
And I know how to get a crowd
Right up and on their feet
So if you want them in it
I'll show you how to get it

[Pre - Chorus: Trevor Tordjman, Emilia McCarthy & Both]
Ain't no mountain we can't climb
Nothing keeps us down
Got that fire in our soul
Never count us out
We got one thing on our minds
Call it victory
Yeah, that's where we're headed
And we know how to get it

[Chorus: All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Post - Chorus: All]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! So get up out of our way
We're fired up, we're fired up
We're fired up
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! So get up out of our way
We're fired up, we're fired up
We're fired up
Aah!

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly, Carla Jeffery]
Been waiting for this day to come
And it was all so clear
Since I was a little girl
I saw me standing here
And all the times they told me "Walk away"
I said "Forget it"
I knew where I was headed
And I was gonna get it

[Pre - Chorus: Meg Donelly]
Ain't no mountain we can't climb
Nothing keeps us down
Got that fire in our soul
Never count us out
We got one thing on our minds
Call it victory
Yeah, that's where we're headed
And we know how to get it
Whoa!

[Chorus: All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Post - Chorus: All]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
No!
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up

Yaah!
Mmm
You guys got moves
But can you win over a crowd?
Get them to worship you
Like they worship me!
[cheering]
Hey, who am I fooling?
Bucky's never gonna let me on the team
He'll cut my wings
I'm never gonna fly
We are the Mighty Shrimp
We wanna hear you shout
From the left and from the right
[booing]
Aw, come on!
You don't have what it takes
Bye!
You'll never be a Shrimp!
Waah-hoo-hoo!
Wow!
Awesome!
Whoo!
[cheering]

[Bridge: Meg Donnelly]
Welcome to the Mighty Shrimps
Turn up the volume now
We are the Mighty Shrimp
It's time to show you now
We got the stuff to light you up
It's getting hotter now
We're getting hotter now
It's getting hotter now

[Chorus: All]
We were made for this
There's nothing we can't do
We came to play
We're here to stay and win the day
'Cause we were made for this
Didn't come here to lose
We came to play, we're here to stay
What's left to say when we know

[Post - Chorus: All]
Nothing's gonna get in our way
No! Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
Nothing's gonna get in our way
Come on, let me hear you say
We're fired up, you're fired up
We're fired up
Fired up, fired up

[cheering]


[NARRATOR, spoken]
Once upon a time
In a far-off kingdom
There lay a small village
At the edge of the woods

[CINDERELLA]
I wish

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And in this village

[CINDERELLA]
More than anything

[NARRATOR, spoken]
Lived a young maiden

[CINDERELLA]
More than life
More than jewels

[NARRATOR, spoken]
A carefree young lad

[JACK]
I wish
More than life

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And a childless baker

[BAKER &  BAKER'S WIFE]
I wish

[NARRATOR, spoken]
With his wife

[BAKER]
More than anything

[WIFE]
More than the moon

[BAKER'S WIFE]
I wish

[CINDERELLA]
The King is giving a Festival

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
More than life

[JACK]
I wish

[CINDERELLA]
I wish to go to the Festival

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
More than riches

[CINDERELLA]
And the ball

[JACK]
I wish my cow would
Give us some milk

[CINDERELLA & BAKER'S WIFE]
More than anything

[BAKER]
I wish we had a child

[JACK]
Please, pal-

[BAKER'S WIFE]
I want a child

[JACK]
Squeeze, pal

[CINDERELLA]
I wish to go to the Festival

[JACK]
I wish you'd give us some
Milk or even cheese
I wish

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
I wish we might have a child
I wish

[STEPMOTHER]
You wish to go to the Festival?

[NARRATOR, spoken]
The poor girl's parents had died

[STEPMOTHER]
You, Cinderella, the Festival?
You wish to go to the Festival?

[FLORINDA]
What, you, Cinderella, the Festival?
The Festival?!

[LUCINDA]
What, you wish to go to the Festival?

[ALL THREE]
The Festival?
The King's Festival?

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And now she lived with her stepmother

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
The Festival?
Ha!

[NARRATOR, spoken]
Who had two daughters of her own

[FLORINDA]
Look at your nails!

[LUCINDA]
Look at your dress!

[STEPMOTHER]
People would laugh at you

[CINDERELLA]
Nevertheless
I still want to go to the Festival
And dance before the Prince

[STEPMOTHER & STEPSISTERS]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[NARRATOR, spoken]
All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart
The young lad had no father and his mother

[JACK'S MOTHER]
I wish

[NARRATOR, spoken]
Well, she was at her wit's end

[JACK'S MOTHER]
I wish my son were not a fool
I wish my house was not a mess
I wish the cow was full of milk
I wish the walls were full of gold
I wish a lot of things
(spoken)
What in heaven's name are you doing
With the cow inside the house?

[JACK, spoken]
I thought if he got nice and warm
He might produce some milk

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
It's a she
How many times do I have to tell you
Only she's can give milk?

[NARRATOR, spoken]
And then there was a hungry little girl
Who always wore a red cape

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
I wish
It's not for me
It's for my Granny in the woods
A loaf of bread, please
To bring my poor old hungry
Granny in the woods
Just a loaf of bread, please

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
Cinderella, if you can pick up these lentils
And finish your chores in time
Then you may go to the ball with us
Come along ladies

[STEPSISTERS, spoken]
Yes, Mother

[LUCINDA, spoken]
Good luck

[CINDERELLA]
Come, little birds
Down from the eaves
And the leaves
Over fields
Out of castles and ponds

[JACK]
Now, squeeze, pal

[CINDERELLA]
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Quick, little birds
Flick through the ashes
Pick and peck, but swiftly
Sift through the ashes
Into the pot

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Now listen to me well, son
Milky-White must be taken to market

[JACK, spoken]
But, mother, no he's the best cow in the world

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Was
She has been dry for weeks now
With no food or money
We've got no choice but to sell her
Look at her

[JACK, spoken]
But, Milky-White's my best friend

[JACK'S MOTHER]
Look at her
There are bugs on her dugs
There are flies in her eyes
There's a lump on her rump
Big enough to be a hump

[JACK, spoken]
But

[JACK'S MOTHER]
We've no time to sit and dither
While she wither's wither with her
And no one keeps a cow for a friend!
(spoken)
Sometimes I wonder what's going on in that head of yours

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods
It's time to go
I hate to leave
I have to go
Into the woods
It's time, and so
I must begin my journey
Into the woods
And through the trees
To where I am
Expected ma'am
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Now you're certain of your way?

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
The way is clear
The light is good
I have no fear
Nor no one should
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood
I sort of hate to ask it
But do you have a basket?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Yes, we do

[BAKER, spoken]
I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Oh, shhhh
Now, don't stray and be late, alright?

[BAKER, spoken]
You might save some of those sweets for Granny?
Oh my

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Just, leave it

[BAKER, spoken]
She's a thief!

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods
And down the dell
The path is straight
I know it well
Into the woods
And who can tell
What's waiting on the journey?
Into the woods
To bring some bread
To Granny who
Is sick in bed
Never can tell
What lies ahead
For all that I know
She's already dead
But into the woods
Into the woods
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
And home before dark

[FLORINDA, spoken]
Cinderella!

[LUCINDA, spoken]
Get up here!

[CINDERELLA]
Fly, birds
Back to the sky

[FLORINDA, spoken]
We're waiting!

[CINDERELLA]
Back to the eaves
And the leaves
And the fields
And the

[FLORINDA]
Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella!
Are you really wearing that?

[LUCINDA]
Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella
Can't you hide it with a hat?

[CINDERELLA]
You look beautiful

[FLORINDA]
I know

[LUCINDA]
She means me

[FLORINDA]
No she didn't

[CINDERELLA]
Mother said be good
Father said be nice
That was always their advice
So be nice, Cinderella
Good, Cinderella
Nice good good nice

[FLORINDA]
Tighter!

[CINDERELLA]
What's the good of being good
If everyone is blind
Always leaving you behind?
Never mind, Cinderella
Kind Cinderella
Nice good nice kind good nice

[FLORINDA, spoken]
Ow! Not that tight!
God!

[BAKER, spoken]
Who might that be?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
We've sold our last loaf of bread!

[BAKER, spoken]
It's the witch from next-door

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
We have no bread

[WITCH, spoken]
I don't want your bread

[BAKER, spoken]
Then what is it you wish?

[WITCH, spoken]
It's not what I wish
It's what you wish
Nothing cooking in that belly now is there?
And there will never be
Unless you do exactly as I say
In three days time a blue-moon will appear
Only then can the curse be, undone

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
What curse?

[WITCH, spoken]
The one I placed on this house

[BAKER, spoken]
What are you talking about?

[WITCH, spoken]
In the past, when you were no more than a babe
Your father brought his young wife
And you to this cottage
They were a lovely couple
But not lovely neighbors
You see
Your mother was with child
And she developed an unusual appetite
She admired my beautiful garden
And she told your father that
What she wanted more than anything
In the world, was
Greens, greens, nothing but greens:
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery
Asparagus and watercress and
Fiddle ferns and lettuce
He said, "All right,"
But it wasn't, quite
Cause I caught him in the autumn
In my garden one night!
He was robbing me
Raping me
Rooting through my rutabaga
Raiding my arugula and
Ripping up the rampion
My champion! My favorite!
I should have laid a spell on him
Right there
I could have turned him into stone
Or a dog...
Or a chair...
But I let him have the rampion-
I'd lots to spare
In return, however
I said, "Fair is fair:
You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear
And we'll call it square."

[BAKER, spoken]
I had a brother?

[WITCH, spoken]
No. But, you had a sister

[BAKER, spoken]
Where is she?

[WITCH, spoken]
She's mine now!
And you'll never find her
Small price to pay for what
Else your father stole from me
It cost me my youth, my beauty
My mother warned me
She would punish me
With the curse of ugliness
If I ever lost any of them

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Lost what?

[WITCH, spoken]
The beans

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Beans?

[WITCH, spoken]
The special beans
I'd let him go, I didn't know
He'd stolen my beans
I was watching him crawl
Back over the wall
Then bang! Crash!
A lightning flash!
Well, that's another story
Never mind-
Anyway, at last
The big day came
And I made my claim
"Oh, don't take away the baby,"
They shrieked and screeched
But I did
And I hid her
Where she'll never be reached
And your father cried
And your mother died
When for extra measure-
I admit it was a pleasure-
I said, "Sorry
I'm still not mollified."
And I laid a little spell on them-
You, too, son-
That your family tree
Would always be a barren one

[BAKER, spoken]
How could you do that?

[WITCH, spoken]
And when your mother died
Your father deserted you
Your father was no father so why should you be?
So there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes
And my garden thrives-
You should see my nectarines!
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens:
Don't ever never ever
Mess around with my greens!
Especially the beans

[JACK, spoken]
Yeah, but why do we have to go to the next village?

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Because, everyone in this village
Knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks

[JACK, spoken]
That's cheating!

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
We're starving, Jack!
Don't you understand that?
Now, you're not to accept less than five pounds for her
Are you listening to me?

[JACK, spoken]
Yes

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
How much are you to ask?

[JACK, spoken]
No more than five pounds

[JACK'S MOTHER, spoken]
Less than five!

[JACK, spoken]
Than five!

[JACK'S MOTHER]
Into the woods
The time is now
We have to live
I don't care how
Into the woods to sell the cow
You must begin the journey!
Straight to the woods
And don't delay
We have to face
The marketplace
Into the woods to journey's end

[JACK]
Into the woods to sell a friend

[WITCH, spoken]
You wish to have
The curse reversed?
I'll need a certain
Potion first
Go to the woods and bring me back
One: the cow as white as milk
Two: the cape as red as blood
Three: the hair as yellow as corn
Four: the slipper as pure as gold
Bring me these
Before the chime
Of midnight
In three day's time
Tis' then the blue moon reappears
Which comes but once each hundred years
Just bring them and
I guarantee
A child as perfect
As child can be
Go to the wood!

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
Ladies
Our carriage waits

[CINDERELLA, spoken]
Now may I go to the Festival?

[STEPMOTHER]
The Festival?
(sung)
Darling, those nails!
Darling, those clothes!
Lentils are one thing but
Darling, with those
You'd make us the fools of the Festival
And mortify the Prince!

[CINDERELLA, spoken]
The Festival lasts three nights
Surely, you could let me be there for one of them

[STEPMOTHER, spoken]
The King is trying to find his son a wife!
Not a scullery maid!
We must be gone!
Go!

[CINDERELLA]
I wish

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Beans?
These must be the witch's beans!
We'll take them with us

[BAKER, spoken]
We?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Yes!

[BAKER, spoken]
We?
You're not coming
It's not safe out there

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
I can help you!

[BAKER, spoken]
No!
I can do this on my own
(sung)
The spell is on my house
Only I can lift the spell
The spell is on my house

[BAKER'S WIFE]
No, no, the spell is on our house
We must lift the spell together
The spell is on our house!

[BAKER, spoken]
Now tell me what am I to return with?

[BAKER'S WIFE, spoken]
Ugh, You don't remember?
(sung)
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold

[BAKER]
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold

[CINDERELLA]
I still wish to go to the Festival
But how am I ever to get to the Festival?

[BAKER]
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn

[CINDERELLA]
I know!
I'll visit Mother's grave
The grave at the willow tree
And tell her I just want to
Go to the King's Festival

[BAKER]
The slipper as pure as gold
The cow, the cape
The slipper as pure as gold

[BAKER'S WIFE]
The hair!

[CINDERELLA & BAKER]
Into the woods
It's time to go
It may be all
In vain, you/I know
Into the woods-
But even so
I have to take the journey

[CINDERELLA, BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
Into the woods
The path is straight
You know it well
But who can tell

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
Into the woods to lift the spell

[CINDERELLA]
Into the woods to visit Mother

[JACK'S MOM]
Into the woods to sell the cow!

[JACK]
To get the money!

[CINDERELLA]
To go to the Festival!

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods to grandmother's house!

[ALL]
The way is clear
The light is good
I have no fear
Nor no one should
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood
No need to be afraid there

[BAKER]
There's something in the glade there

[ALL]
Into the woods
Without delay
But careful not
To lose the way
Into the woods
Who knows what may
Be lurking on the journey?
Into the woods
To get the thing
That makes it worth
The journeying
Into the woods

[STEPMOTHER & STEPSISTERS]
To see the King

[JACK & JACK'S MOTHER]
To sell the cow

[BAKER & BAKER'S WIFE]
To make the potion

[ALL]
To see
To sell
To get
To bring
To make
To lift
To go to the Festival!
Into the woods!
Into the woods!
Into the woods
Then out of the woods
And home before it's dark!

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel...

(sung)
Look at you, as fragile as a flower
Still a little sapling, just a sprout
You know why we stay up in this tower

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I know but...

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
That's right, to keep you safe and sound, dear
Guess I always knew this day was coming
Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest
Soon, but not yet

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
But --

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Shh!
Trust me, pet
Mother knows best

Mother knows best
Listen to your mother
It's a scary world out there
Mother knows best
One way or another
Something will go wrong, I swear
Ruffians, thugs
Poison ivy, quicksand
Cannibals and snakes
The plague

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
No!

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Yes!

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
But --

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Also large bugs
Men with pointy teeth, and
Stop, no more, you'll just upset me
Mother's right here
Mother will protect you
Darling, here's what I suggest
Skip the drama
Stay with mama
Mother knows best

Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy
On your own, you won't survive
Sloppy, underdressed
Immature, clumsy
Please, they'll eat you up alive
Gullible, naïve
Positively grubby
Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague
Plus, I believe
Gettin' kinda chubby
I'm just saying cause I wuv you
Mother understands
Mother's here to help you
All I have is one request

(spoken)
Rapunzel?

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
Yes?

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
Yes, Mother

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
I love you very much, dear

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I love you more

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
I love you most

(sung)
Don't forget it
You'll regret it
Mother knows best


[MOANA & ENSEMBLE]
Ou mata e matagi
I have crossed the horizon to find you
Ou loto mamaina toa
I know your name
Manatu atu
They have stolen the heart from inside you
Taku pelepele
But this does not define you
Manatunatu
This is not who you are
You know who you are


[Verse 1]
Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Verse 2]
Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Refrain]
There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah


[Verse 1]
Here you are alone, and you deserve it
Your friends have turned to stone
And that's on you
You had a cause to serve but did you serve it?
Or did you see yourself in a way that wasn't true?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is not your father's fairytale
And no, it's not your mother's fault you fail
So when your story comes to light
Make sure the story that they write

[Chorus 1]
Goes once upon a time a girl tried harder
Once upon a time she tried again
Once upon a braver choice
She took a risk
She used her voice
And that will be my once upon a time
This time

[Verse 2]
Why tell all those lies?
You feel unworthy
Like there isn't solid ground for you to stand
But a stack of lies is not a firm foundation
You cannot build a castle on a mountain made of sand

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is not your mother's dark desire
And no, it's not your father's hair on fire
Turns out it's you who's not awake
So if there's change you wanna make

[Chorus 2]
Take once upon a time she fought a dragon
Once upon a time that beast was me
Once upon a misspent youth
She faced herself
She spoke the truth
That's how I see my once upon a time
This time

[Verse 3]
Life is not a storybook but life unfolds in chapters
Turn the page and start to make amends
There's no pre-written guarantee of "Happily ever after"
Step into your greatness before your story ends
So when your story ends

[Chorus 3]
They'll say once upon a time a girl flew higher
Once upon a time she made things right
Once upon a tie that binds
She changed her heart
To change their minds
That's got to be my once upon a time

[Outro]
This once upon a time
I'll finally see my once upon a time
This time
